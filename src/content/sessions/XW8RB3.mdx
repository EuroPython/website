You use the Python interpreter every single day. It does a lot of things for you: checks that your code has valid syntax and is properly indented, imports modules from various locations, and runs your code instruction-by-instruction.

But if you've ever wondered how exactly it happens, this talk will teach you the entire process, by building a working python interpreter from scratch.
