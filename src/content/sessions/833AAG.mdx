Everyone who writes also distributes Python code. The only reliable way to share Python code is by packaging it, any other way hurts your consumers. Packaging can be an intimidating topic most would rather avoid but following just a few best practices of packaging can make your code much easier to share, even without going through the process of uploading to pypi.org.
