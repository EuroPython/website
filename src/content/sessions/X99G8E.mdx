Over the years we have many Python extensions written in Rust, for performance, safety/security being the primary reason. This workshop is meant for Python programmers (who may never touched Rust before) to try out writing a fully working extension with various features.

Before workshopp:

- Install Rust via https://rustup.rs
- Install Python development package and dependencies from https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/#install-dependencies
