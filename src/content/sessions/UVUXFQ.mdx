title: Adding zero-downtime migrations strategy in a SaaS project
track: Web (2023)
tweet: When operating a web-based SaaS application, it is important to provide software
  updates without any downtime. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to accomplish
  this by introducing a zero-downtime migration strategy.

Zero-downtime migration is a technique for running database migrations without stopping the web app. As clients' databases grow larger, applying necessary updates to the database can become time-consuming or potentially break the database schema. This talk will describe problematic operation types and provide a strategy for writing and running migrations to release new software versions without downtime.
