Dive into the realm of mathematical modeling in this hands-on workshop, where numbers unlock insights into disease spread, weather patterns, and financial behaviors. Tom and Gurjot lead a journey spanning Classical Physics, Mathematical Biology, Finance, and Chaos Theory.

From tweaking Mechanics models for surprising outcomes to tracking infectious diseases like COVID-19, each segment offers engaging examples, and an opportunity to understand the uses and applications of calculus and differential equations through the lens of Python.

Suitable for beginners and experts alike, Tom and Gurjot are experienced at using Python for mathematical modelling and are ready to give their thoughts and answer questions, however simple or advanced. Gurjot shares firsthand knowledge from the finance world, unveiling the intricate models shaping modern markets. Tom brings his experience from weather, climate and energy, exploring Chaos Theory's role in weather prediction, and demonstrating tools for understanding atmospheric dynamics.

This interactive session isn't just about learning—it's about empowerment. Armed with Python skills and a deeper understanding of mathematical models, participants gain the confidence to explore further, starting with the notebooks we have refined and expanded for EuroPython 2024.

Join this journey of discovery, where mathematics meets real-world challenges, and Python becomes your toolkit for exploration.
