Python has been evolving very rapidly in the last few years, and this is because new ideas have been taking over the Core Development. New ideas require new people, a new background and lots of energy.

This panel aims for the people to be aware of the changes that are coming in 3.13, and future versions, as well as ways people can contribute by testing features, fixing issues, or even sharing their own ideas.

Host: Konstantin Ignatov
Panelists: Pablo Galindo Salgado, ≈Åukasz Langa,  Carol Willing, Hugo van Kemenade, Victor Stinner and Petr Viktorin
