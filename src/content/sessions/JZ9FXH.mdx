In this hands-on tutorial we will reinvent the wheel!

We'll reinvent the wheel and implement the module `itertools` in plain Python.

We'll do that because it's fun, but also because that will teach us a lot about Python:

 - the difference between iterables and iterators;
 - what the built-ins `iter` and `next` do;
 - how Python handles iterations and `for` loops under the hood;
 - what the iterator protocol is;
 - how the dunder methods `__iter__` and `__next__` play a part in all this; and
 - we'll also learn about the functions inside `itertools`, a module with plenty of useful tools for your day-to-day iterations.
