A Jupyter notebook is quite handy for rapid REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) style tasks
such as exploratory data analysis and data science. However, we would feel
deficiencies in proper SW engineering supports at some point as the notebook grows
to have larger and more complicated code. It is because the Jupyter notebook lacks
several important features including code sharing, refactoring support,
version control and advanced editing. Fortunately, traditional full-fledged IDEs,
such as *VS Code* or *PyCharm*, are available at hand and they support
these lacking features very well.
Then, why donâ€™t we take advantage of the best of both worlds?

In this beginner-level hands-on talk, I will demonstrate how to
transform Jupyter notebook workflows to a proper Python package using *VS Code*.
I will also introduce several basic but essential refactoring recommendations.
By doing so, you can use the package for several notebooks
and even share with your colleagues and friends.
