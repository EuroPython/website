Answer this : In critical domains like Healthcare would you prefer a Jack-of-all-trades OR one Yoda, the master?

Join me on an exhilarating journey as we delve deep into the Mixture of Experts (MoE) technique which is a practical and intuitive next-step to elevate predictive powers of generalised know-it-all models.

A powerful approach to solve a variety of ML tasks, MoE operates on the principle of Divide and Conquer with some less obvious limitations, pros, and cons. You’ll go through a captivating exploration of insights, intuitive reasoning, solid mathematical underpinnings, and a treasure trove of interesting examples!

We'll kick off by surveying the landscape, from ensemble models to stacked estimators, gradually ascending towards the pinnacle of MoE. Along the way, we'll explore challenges, alternative routes, and the crucial art of knowing when to wield the MoE magic—AND when to hold back. Brace yourselves for a business-oriented finale, where we discuss metrics around cost, latency, and throughput for MoE models. And fear not! We'll wrap up with an array of resources equipping you to dive headfirst into pre-trained MoE models, fine-tune them, or even forge your own from scratch. May the force of Experts be with you !"
