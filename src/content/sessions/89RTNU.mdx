"Everything in Python is an object." This is a profound truth about Python, but what does it mean? Is literally EVERYTHING an object? And what is an object anyway? Are objects the same as instances of a class? How do classes and types really work in Python? And what do metaclasses have to do with anything?

In fact, the answers to these questions are probably not what you think they are - Python's approach to objects is different from most other languages in sometimes surprising ways.

This talk will use simple live coded examples to explore how objects work in Python and clear up several common misconceptions and misunderstandings about how objects and instances, classes and types, and metaclasses all work together.

Be warned - you are likely to be surprised when you learn the truth about objects in Python.
