Join us as we celebrate a significant milestone: the 10th anniversary of Django Girls, an initiative born at EuroPython 2014 in Berlin.

If you're a woman interested in learning how to build websites, we have fantastic news for you! We are hosting a beginner-friendly, one-day workshop.

We believe the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program!

Workshops are free of charge.
