Ever wished you had a smart fridge that both lists and alerts you with ingredients you have, to waste less food and make the best use of what you have through ingredient-recipe match?

Bingo then that I'll share the story behind the creation of a Python-powered solution that maximizes ingredient usage, minimizes food waste by keeping track of your ingredients and streamlines the cooking process.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’ª

Let's explore together, how snapping a photo of your fridge to generating recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, this project embodies the creativity, problem-solving, and excitement inherent in project development.

Join me as I recount the challenges, and lessons learned along the way, highlighting the transformative impact of project development on skill enhancement and contribution to boost the ways we think as developers. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious novice, this talk offers valuable insights into the joys and rewards of turning ideas into reality through coding.
