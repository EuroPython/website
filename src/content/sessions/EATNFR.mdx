As the number of production machine learning use-cases increase, we find ourselves facing new and bigger challenges where more is at stake. Because of this, it's critical to identify the key areas to focus our efforts, so we can ensure our machine learning pipelines are reliable and scalable. In this talk we dive into the state of production machine learning, and we will cover the concepts that make production machine learning so challenging, as well as some of the recommended tools available to tackle these challenges.
