This talk is meant to be an hitchhickers guide to **Dungeons and Dragons** (`D&D`) _for programmers_.
We will leverage on our wit and intelligence to explore a very perilious dungeon üßô , where a venomous dragon is hiding in the shadows üêâ .
Thanks to a magical potion in an ancient flask, our wizardly skills have been enhanced with Pythonic capabilities üêç making us the most powerful and geeky magician of the realm.
These new acquired power revealed _unprecedented strategies_ (i.e. algorithms üôÉ) that will guide us through the maze avoiding all the traps and pitfalls ‚öîÔ∏è, and will help us maximising the power of our _fire magic_ ‚òÑÔ∏è to finally slay the dragon.

If you would like to know more about this new Pythonic spell, and the secrets it unveiled, or if you're simply interested in **new graph algorithms** that can run balzingly _fast_ maximising your CPU capabilities, **this is the talk for you!**
