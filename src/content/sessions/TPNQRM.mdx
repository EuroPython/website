After a huge amount of work from many people, NumPy 2.0.0 has been released, the first major NumPy release since 2006! Among the many new features, several changes to both the Python API and the C API, and a great deal of documentation improvements, there was also a lot of work on improving the performance of string operations.

In this talk, we'll go through the timeline of the changes and the resulting performance improvements, while also diving deep into NumPy ufunc internals and explaining topics like NumPy (parametric) dtypes, type promotion and more.
