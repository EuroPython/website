As a developer, you play a crucial role in the security of your projects. At the same time, it can be difficult to know if what you’re doing is enough. Luckily, you don’t have to be a security expert to contribute to the security of your projects. Instead, you can use industry standards as a guide for your approach to security.

In this talk, I will introduce you to a framework that is especially accessible to developers, the [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/), and help you get started with a systematic approach to improving the security of your projects.
