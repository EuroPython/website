Pydantic Logfire — Uncomplicated Observability

From the team behind Pydantic, Logfire is a new type of observability platform built on the same belief as our open source library — that the most powerful tools can be easy to use.

In this talk we'll introduce Logfire, then demonstrate how it can make understanding and fixing your app faster and more enjoyable with a live demo.

We'll touch on some of the most useful integrations including: FastAPI, Postgres and OpenAI.
