It's great when you can share the results of your analysis not only as a presentation but as something that non-data scientists can explore on their own, looking for insights and applying their business expertise to understand the significance of what they find.

With its accessibility for both creators and viewers, Streamlit offers a brilliant platform for data scientists to build and deploy data apps. Now, with the integration of [ipyvizzu](https://ipyvizzu.vizzuhq.com/latest/) - a new, open-source data visualization tool focusing on animation and storytelling - you can quickly create and publish interactive, animated reports and dashboards on top of static or dynamic data sets and your models.
