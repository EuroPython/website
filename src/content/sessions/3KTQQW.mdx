Welcome to EuroPython 2023! You can pick up your badges at any time during the week as long as we are open! If you want to avoid the morning rush on Wednesday, come on Monday and Tuesday!

Queues will be sorted by your **first name** on your ticket. Your ticket can be located via your order confirmation email (from support@pretix.eu with the Subject: Your order: XXXX). If you ordered your ticket after we've sent badges for printing (after 10 July), go directly to the Info Desk (also referred as Debugging Desk) and a volunteer will help!
