As engineers, aspiring or experienced, we can become so focused on growing our
technical skills that we forget about the basics. The ability to communicate
well can be seen as a skill needed by leaders, managers or client-facing
colleagues, but in reality it forms the basis of the quality of our work. From
understanding client requirements, to code reviews and even naming variables,
communication is a fundamental part of our profession and something we could all
benefit from being more conscious of.

In this open-to-all-levels talk weâ€™ll discuss in what situations we should pay
closer attention to our style of communication, explore the role of empathy in
writing and reviewing code and cover tips and tricks for both making yourself
understood and better understanding others.
