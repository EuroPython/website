This talk will focus on implementing a password rotation strategy for your database without disrupting your Django server or other applications that consume the database. Regular password rotation is a critical security practice, but it can pose challenges for applications and servers that rely on the password for access. We will discuss the importance of password rotation and explore the challenges of rotating passwords for a database in use by a Django server. We will also discuss several techniques for safely rotating database passwords, such as using connection pools and leveraging environmental variables. By the end of the session, attendees will better understand the security risks associated with static passwords and how to mitigate those risks through password rotation while keeping their Django server and other applications running smoothly.
