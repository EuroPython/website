title: Demystify Python Types for PEP 729
track: Python Internals & Ecosystem
tweet: Have you heard about PEP 729 which proposes a new way to govern the Python's
  type specifications? Let's dive deep together into the type systems together in
  EuroPython 2024!

[PEP 729 – Typing governance process](https://peps.python.org/pep-0729/) proposes a new way to govern the Python type system. The PEP was endorsed by maintainers of all major type checkers. This talk aims to guide audience to understand the reason more deeply of this new process after demystifying Python types.

In this talk, the speaker will demystify python types from their theory to practice along with Python type systems. The theory includes the type theory by [Per Martin-Löf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_Martin-L%C3%B6f)'s and [gradual typing by Jeremy Siek](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/13-siek.pdf), all theories will be explained with the Python code in the real world. The type systems targets all major type checkers and CPython. The comparison will be based on the research: [Python 3 Types in the Wild: A Tale of Two Type Systems](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/docs/dls2020.pdf). The practice covers how a new specifications is done in type systems. In addition, the speaker will share their thoughts about the challenges behind the implementation, and connect the answer to the reason of the PEP 729.
