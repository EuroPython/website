Distributed databases are widely used in modern applications for their high availability and scalability. Have you ever wondered how data integrity is maintained with the data across multiple nodes? One of the key components of achieving this is distributed consensus. Raft is a widely used consensus algorithm that provides a fault-tolerant and highly available system. In this talk, we will explore how to implement Raft consensus using the rqlite distributed database in python.
