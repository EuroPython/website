What's this thing called **MLOps**? You may have heard about it by now, but never really understood what all the fuzz is about. Let's find out together!

In this tutorial, you will learn about MLOps and take your first steps in a hands-on way. To do so, we will be using **Open Source** tooling. We will be taking a simple example of Machine Learning use case and will gradually make it more ready for production üöÄ.

We start with a simple time-series model in Python using scikit-learn and first add logging steps to make the performance of the model measurable. Don't worry: we will go through it step-by-step, so you won't be overwhelmed. Then, we will log our ML model and load it back into an inference step. Lastly, we will learn about deploying these actual models by Dockerizing our application üôè.
