HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. It also includes a built-in command-line client.

We'll be taking a look at the architecture of the client, learning from the design decisions behind it, and gaining a better understanding of HTTP along the way.
