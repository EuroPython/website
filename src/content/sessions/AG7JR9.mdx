This talk will provide an introduction to Integer Programming and demonstrate how it can be used for conference scheduling. We will explore the basics of Integer Programming and how it can be applied to optimize the allocation of talks to time slots and rooms in a conference program. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a better understanding of how this powerful tool can help to create an efficient and effective conference schedule that maximizes attendee satisfaction. Whether you're a conference organizer or simply interested in learning more about optimization algorithms, this talk is for you!
