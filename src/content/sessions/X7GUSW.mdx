Every day, as software continues to “eat the world”, applications increasingly
grow in complexity. Nowhere else is this phenomenon more prevalent than in big
organizations, which over time have hired more people to develop and maintain
more features. There, it is no longer possible to have a complete mental model
of what is going on. Enterprise software, when unchecked, bloats and becomes
brittle. Paradoxically, engineers build software to keep complexity at bay, not
to create it. When writing code, the goal is to make processes less labor
intensive and more reliable. Yet, enterprise software has become a black hole
for man-hours. Python disrupted Java to become the de facto programming language
for enterprises precisely because it tackled this problem in a way that Java, or
any other programming language, could not. How is that so? This talk will dive
deep into this exact question. What does Python offer that radically changed how
software gets built in organizations, both big and small?. And why is it that
newer languages that have come along, such as Go and Rust, haven’t been able to
put a dent on its dominions, and have been forced to recede into niche use
cases. This talk is for engineers who want to understand and leverage Python to
its maximum maintainability potential. They intuitively understand that Python
is a great tool for that, but are unsure as to how to do it.
