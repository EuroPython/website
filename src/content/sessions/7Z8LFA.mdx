Using type hints in Python has many advantages, some of which might not be obvious at first. We will see that it allows us to explicitly encode invariants in our code, which reduces the amount of tests that we need to write, it improves development speed and maintainability, and perhaps most importantly, it can give us more confidence that our code does what we expect it to do.

We will also go through code examples that will show us how to leverage typing in Python to design APIs that cannot be easily misused, to create robust programs that we can trust.

Audience members are expected to be able to read and understand Python code.
