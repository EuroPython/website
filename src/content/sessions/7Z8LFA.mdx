  "The many benefits of type hints in Python: leveraging types to gain more
  confidence in the correctness of our code and to improve development speed."

Using type hints in Python has many advantages, some of which might not be
obvious at first. We will see that it allows us to explicitly encode invariants
in our code, which reduces the amount of tests that we need to write, it
improves development speed and maintainability, and perhaps most importantly, it
can give us more confidence that our code does what we expect it to do.

We will also go through code examples that will show us how to leverage typing
in Python to design APIs that cannot be easily misused, to create robust
programs that we can trust.

Audience members are expected to be able to read and understand Python code.
