In the evolving landscape of serverless and cloud technologies, Python stands out as a key player for building microservices. Yet, as these systems grow, tracking their performance and catching bugs become increasingly complex.

This presentation introduces OpenTelemetry, a rising standard that equips us with tools to monitor not just Python code but also vital components like databases and message queues. It's designed to blend seamlessly with Python, offering a unified method to collect, process, and share telemetry data across different parts of a distributed system.

This talk starts by discussing the importance of observability in modern distributed environments. Then, we'll dive into OpenTelemetry, focusing on its Python SDK's basics. We'll walk through a hands-on example, showing how to integrate OpenTelemetry into a Python project for automated and manual tracking.

Finally, we'll explore how to leverage the insights gained from OpenTelemetry for more effective system monitoring, ensuring smoother operation and easier troubleshooting.
