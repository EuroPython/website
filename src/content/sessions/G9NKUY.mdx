Music streaming services like Spotify and youtube are famous for their recommendation systems and each service takes a unique approach to recommending and personalize content. While most users are happy with the recommendations provided, there are a section of users who are curious how and why a certain track is recommended. Complex recommendation systems take various factors like track metadata, user metadata, and play counts along with the track content itself. 

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy to build an own GPT, we have to use Language Models to build our own music recommendation system.
