From recommendation systems to LLM-based applications, vector search is a critical component of the modern AI workflow. Existing vector solutions are complicated to use, hard to maintain, and cost too much. LanceDB is a free open-source vector store that can perform low latency vector search on billion-scale vector datasets on a single node.
