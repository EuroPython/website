Join me on the journey of me trying to battle the Sun for a few more precious moments of shut-eye using MQTT and python. As a creature who adores city lights during the night but detests being rudely awakened by the blinding Sun, I embarked on a quest to automate my curtains using Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, light sensors and MQTT. From ingenious ideas to comical mishaps, and eventually stumbling upon a somewhat functional solution, this talk promises laughter, learning, and a peek into the thrillingly world of microprocessor programming with python.

**Target Audience:**

- Pythonistas with a penchant for puns and conquering the mundane with code.
- Aspiring IoT alchemists seeking to turn sensor readings into automated gold (or at least, uninterrupted sleep).
- Anyone who enjoys learning through laughter and the occasional "print('facepalm')".

**Benefits for Attendees:**

- Gain practical knowledge of **MQTT and its Pythonic potential**.
- Learn to craft **multi-layered solutions** that combine sensors, user control, and API integration.
- Embrace the **iterative nature of development** and learn to laugh at your code (trust me, it helps).
