Finding good datasets or web assets to build data products or websites with, respectively, can be time-consuming. For instance, data professionals might require data from heavily regulated industries like healthcare and finance. In contrast, software developers might want to skip the tedious task of collecting images, text, and videos for a website. Luckily, both scenarios can now benefit from the same solution, Synthetic Data.

Synthetic Data is artificially generated data created with machine learning models, algorithms, and simulations, and this workshop is designed to show you how to enter that synthetic world by teaching you how to create a full-stack tech product with five interrelated projects. These projects include reproducible data pipelines, a dashboard, machine learning models, a web interface, and a documentation site. So, if you want to enhance your data projects or find great assets to build websites with, come and spend 3 fun and knowledge-rich hours in this workshop.
