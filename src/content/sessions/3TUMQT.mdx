Computer pRogramming, Technology, Bit-coinism Success, Climate Change and Billionaires are all associated with one another.
This talk will describe how a cohort of  299+ young people (aged 11-14) were introduced to Python Programming, at the same time, for the very first time.
And in this talk, I  would like to share with a great secret in that I have actually learnt more from the young students than they learnt from me.
This talk is about how these young people have opened my eyes, mind  and heart about alternative ways of looking at and appreciating:-
The humble IF statement;  the under-rated FOR loop, the dry Return Statement, the functional Maths & Random modules, etc. as if one were an artist.
We will talk about the renewed delight of looking at these things from fresh pairs of eyes and how we can take these new learnings forward.
