Abstract:
Data validation is a critical component of any software application, ensuring that the data processed by the application is accurate and consistent. However, data validation can often be a tedious and error-prone process, especially when dealing with complex data structures. Pydantic, a powerful and flexible data validation library for Python, simplifies the process of data validation by providing a declarative syntax that is easy to read and write.
