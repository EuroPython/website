How can you scale Python to run at petabyte scale, with the reliability needed to trade billions of dollars? With ArcticDB we have been doing exactly that for the last four years, by leveraging interoperability between Python and high-performance C++, with a detailed understanding of the data structures inside Python and a few extra tricks up our sleeves.

Come take a peek under Python's bonnet and learn how to hotwire a few things along the way.
