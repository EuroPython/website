Early in physicist Richard Feynman’s career, he worked on the top-secret Manhattan Project, stepping in for someone who lost sight of the overall goal. The original employee forgot what he should have built, and got fired! By contrast, Feynman’s ability to understand the big picture and create something valuable kept him in the job, and later on helped him to do the valuable research that earned him the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Fast-forward to the present, where the issue of not “building the right thing” crops up all over software development. There are a whole host of reasons we may not end up delivering what our user, stakeholder or team actually needs from us.

In this talk, I'll help you make sure that whatever you create is valuable - or at the very least, Nobel Prize-winning.
