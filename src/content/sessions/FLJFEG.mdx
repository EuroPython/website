title: 'Syft: Data Science in Python with privacy guarantees'
track: 'PyData: Machine Learning, Stats'
tweet: Privacy guarantees is an essential requirement for ethical data science, but
  also unlocks unprecedented access to ai and models. Come to my talk to discover
  all about Syft for private and secure data science in Python.

In today's data-driven world, privacy stands as an essential requirements for the ethical and effective practice of data science. Moreover, the implementation of robust privacy guarantees in data analysis not only protects sensitive information, but also unlocks the potential for unprecedented democratisation of models and datasets.

[Syft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) is an open source stack that provides **secure** and **private** Data Science in Python. `Syft` decouples private data from model training, using techniques like [Federated Learning](https://blog.research.google/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html), and [Encrypted Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption).
Moreover, Syft provides a numpy-like interface to integrate with deep learning frameworks so that it is easier to replicate any existing workflows while using privacy-enhancing techniques.

In the first part of my talk I will introduce PETs (Privacy Enhancing Technologies), and discuss OpenMined mission to democratise access to AI models and datasets. Afterwards, I will demonstrate how `PySyft` works, and how it can be used to run a machine learning experiments, with privacy guarantees.
