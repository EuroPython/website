We often associate the need for leadership skills with being in a management position. But...we start needing them a lot earlier in our career to succeed and have a positive impact. The diverse workspaces and communities are here to stay, though almost none of us have learned in school how to thrive in diversity. Nor how to be inclusive. We are all somewhere on a journey of inclusive leadership! In this talk we can find out how to asses where we are. And why we should approach inclusive leadership with a beginners mindset, try to do better, make mistakes, learn, repeat. And why we should all be hyped about it.
