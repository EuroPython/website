Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a privacy-enhancing technology that
enables performing computations over encrypted data. FHE has recently seen a lot
of progress, and commercial applications of FHE are now available. One of the
main application domains for FHE is privacy-preserving machine learning. We
introduce a Python interface for OpenFHE, a popular open-source FHE C++ software
library that supports all common FHE schemes. OpenFHE is a NumFocus-sponsored
open-source project that has been authored by a community of well-known FHE
cryptographers and software engineers.The talk provides a high-level
introduction to FHE and its applications, and then provides an overview of the
Python API. Several examples are presented to both illustrate FHE concepts and
show the practicality of the technology.
