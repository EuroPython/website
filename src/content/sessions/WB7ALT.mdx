You don't have to be an Ops expert to make Kubernetes useful! In this workshop, you will learn how to overcome complexity, and love Kubernetes as a Platform to deploy a Python web application or your data science and machine learning pipelines. You will learn how and when to use basic elements of Kubernetes like Deployments and Stateful Sets.

Once you understand these basic elements, you will learn how to extend Kubernetes using Python.
You will learn how to define custom resources and controllers to automate all things related to your applications' life cycle, from ETL through sending email for password reset to where your imagination stops.

In the end of this workshop, you will have deployed a python web application and successfully extend Kubernetes with so-called operators to manage the complete life-cycle of your application.
