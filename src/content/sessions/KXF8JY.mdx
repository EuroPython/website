Have you ever asked yourself if Large Language Models (LLMs) perform differently across various languages? I have.

In this poster session, I will demonstrate how tokens, embeddings, and the LLMs themselves perform when utilized in 30 different languages. I will illustrate how languages influence pricing and various model characteristics.

Spoiler:
- The Greek language is the most expensive to process by most models.
- Processing Asian languages on Gemini is cheaper.
- You can save up to 15% of tokens by removing diacritics.
