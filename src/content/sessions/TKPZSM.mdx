Magic happens every time you take your phone out of your pocket. Somehow, just by looking at the screen, your phone recognizes you (and only you) and magically unlocks.

Have you ever stopped for a minute and thought to yourself - How does that even work? And maybe more importantly, how secure is it?

In this session, we're going to understand how facial recognition works under the hood. We'll dive into some potential security problems, and we'll show you how we were able to break into a biometric database built on the Dlib-python-library by applying a sophisticated brute-force attack. The results will surprise you.
