title: "Bulletproof Python \u2013 Writing fewer tests with a typed code base"
track: Software Engineering & Architecture (2023)
tweet: "Michael's talk \"Bulletproof Python \u2013 Writing fewer tests with a typed\
  \ code base\" investigates how the typing module can be leveraged to write fewer\
  \ lines of code using dependent types and exhaustiveness checking."

A fully typed code base requires less test code to achieve the same level of confidence in its correctness. We'll analyze specific code examples and see how dependent types and exhaustiveness checking make certain classes of tests obsolete.
