This tutorial aims to demystify asyncio builtin module by implementing it from scratch without any dependencies other than the Python Standard Library. We will go through the problem of blocking IO and how it is possible to solve it without single "async" and "await" statement using native Python concepts. Then, we will demystify async/await syntax and see how it is implemented. We will also build our own scheduler which will have a similar API as asyncio, which will be able to run async functions the same way asyncio does. And finally we will build real asynchronous http proxy using our own asyncio implementation. Why reinvent the wheel? - "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.".
