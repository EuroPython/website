Open source is only possibly through open collaboration, and collaboration is
only successful through open-mindedness to new and different perspectives. Yet,
there are still many challenges when it comes to diversity in open source. How
do we intentionally diversify while still being genuine? What can we do to make
it feel authentic and not just like we are filling quotas? Join this talk to
learn how to avoid common pitfalls of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I)
efforts with concrete examples that can be implemented right away, and get a new
perspective in diversifying open source, as Jessica shares her journey as a
blind woman in tech.

We will dive into how we make our project, team, or workplace more diverse by
following a story from someone in multiple minority groups, shedding light on
some of the right reasons to diversify with concrete examples that can be
efficiently implemented right away.
