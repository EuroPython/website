Whisper AI, a model from OpenAI, has been largely overlooked despite its impressive ability to accurately transcribe and translate human speech from audio.

In this talk I will explore the architecture of the model and explain why it works so well. Additionally, I will live demo the model's capabilities in three languages, showing how you can use it on your own computer to generate English subtitles for a wide range of content.
