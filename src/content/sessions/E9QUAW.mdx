There are two hard problems in programming: naming things and cache invalidation. I'll cover the latter, in a microservice-based system. Given a fairly standard setup with API Gateway and a backend service with its own database, I'll show how to implement cache that allows us to avoid database queries without modifying API client.

The whole talk is based on live coding.
