Are you a complete beginner to coding, but would love to learn how to get started? Have you been curious about data science, but feel overwhelmed with all the talk of AI? Many people working in data science were once in the same position and know how hard it is to take those first steps.

However, fear not! It’s easier than you think to get started, and to help make this transition easier we’re hosting a workshop to teach beginners how to get started in Python and data science. We’ll start with Python basics, and show you how you can use this knowledge to easily read and transform data using Pandas, Python’s powerful data analysis library. You’ll also see how you can create beautiful, customized visualizations in Python using packages such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. You’ll also learn how to use a core data science tool, Jupyter notebooks, to run and check the output of your code. See more details on the workshop here: https://ep2023.europython.eu/humble-data
