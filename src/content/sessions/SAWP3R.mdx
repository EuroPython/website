  Want to write cleaner code with less effort? Pre-commit hooks make it easy to
  improve and maintain code quality. In this workshop, you will learn how to set
  them up on your own repos + how to build your own hooks.

Maintaining code quality can be challenging, no matter the size of your project
or number of contributors. Different team members may have different opinions on
code styling and preferences for code structure, while solo contributors might
find themselves spending a considerable amount of time making sure the code
conforms to accepted conventions. However, manually inspecting and fixing issues
in files is both tedious and error-prone. As such, computers are much more
suited to this task than humans. Pre-commit hooks are a great way to have a
computer handle this for you.

Pre-commit hooks are code checks that run whenever you attempt to commit your
changes with `git`. They can detect and, in some cases, automatically correct
code-quality issues _before_ they make it to your code base. In this tutorial,
you will learn how to install and configure pre-commit hooks for your repository
to ensure that only code that passes your checks makes it into your code base.
We will also explore how to build custom pre-commit hooks for novel use cases.
