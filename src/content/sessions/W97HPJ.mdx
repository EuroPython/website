There are a lot of resources on containerizing Python applications with Docker,
but most are basic and outdated. Following them results in slow builds and
potentially insecure applications. Let's see how we can build better containers
using recent Docker features!

This talk will show how to speed up your builds and make your images smaller and
more secure. We'll use features such as multi-stage builds or cache mounts to
build containers with Python apps. We will also discuss how to improve the
security of your container.

Tips from the talk are valid for applications of all sizes and kinds: from hobby
projects to enterprises, from CLI tools to web applications and APIs. You will
be able to apply them immediately after the talk.

Basic knowledge of Docker and its key concepts (images, layers, Dockerfile
commands) is required. You'll learn something new even if you have used Docker
for some time.
