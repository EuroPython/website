Are you new to EuroPython or any Python conference? You must have a lot of questions like:

    What is a Lightning Talk?
    What is an Open Space?
    Besides going to talk, what else can I do?
    Why everyone seems to know each other, how can I join in conversations?

Don't worry, we are here to help you get the most out of your first EuroPython experience. Come to join us in this Beginner Conference Orientation that is tailor made for you.
