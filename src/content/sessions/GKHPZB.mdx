Django and Python make fullstack and API web projects a breeze. But as Python has matured, significant tooling has risen to improve the development experience (DX). Can you use this tooling, in a modern editor and IDE, to stay in the flow and make your development…joyful?

In this session we’ll put PyCharm to work, at helping us work. Navigation, refactoring, autocomplete – the usual suspects. We’ll also see “test-first” development to stay in the IDE, plus how this can apply to frontends.
