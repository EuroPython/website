Caching data and calculation results in jupyter notebooks is a great way to
speed up development by making expensive cells easier to re-run.

Data scientists and developers using notebooks on a daily basis, can improve
their notebook workflow with low-effort changes in the notebook code, cut the
time spent waiting and reduce context switches.

This talk targets developers and data scientist of all experience levels and
will cover:

Why caching in notebooks? Setting up the context in which developers and data
scientists use notebooks for exploratory work and how caching is relevant in it.

What is caching Quick definition of caching, introducing the different types of
persistence (in-memory, on disk, database, object storage …), cache invalidation
strategies (parameters, code changes, ttl, …), with some cautionary comments
about data security when caching protected data.

Caching Techniques Going through readily available options from the python
standard library, and how to use them in notebooks. Introducing a few
off-the-shelves options like ipython % magics, and cachetools. Showcasing how
one would build their own mini-caching framework, that fits for their specific
use case, using pandas and spark for the example Explaining when to stop trying
to cache, and keeping the caching framework mini, what are the signs that
caching went overboard.
