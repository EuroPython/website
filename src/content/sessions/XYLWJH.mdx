Many of our sponsors are looking to hire talented people and EuroPython is the perfect place to reach out to them!

In this session, our sponsors will each give a short presentation about their company and what they do with Python. You will meet and hear the exciting opportunities from JetBrains. Kraken Technologies, Microsoft, Optiver, Sentry, Temporal Technologies, Google Cloud, Numberly and Arm. Afterwards, you can approach them directly in their sponsor booth to carry on the conversation!
