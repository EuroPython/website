The motivation behind this panel is to provide insights to the audience with regards to funding open source projects, manage the community interaction, and options people might find attractive in order to be paid while doing Open source.

We can also observe the sustainability of a project by the amount of contributors, even if itâ€™s code or activities around it like conferences, communities, and NGOs that support the ecosystem.
