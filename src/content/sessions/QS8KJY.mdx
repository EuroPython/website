Have you seen platforms like LinkedIn or Instagram experiencing downtime? We
know how frustrating it might have felt for users, don't we? To tackle this
challenge, engineering teams utilize a variety of tools and practices to
thoroughly understand the unexpected behavior of the system by tracing potential
bottlenecks. We are living in an ever-growing distributed world, where
applications are often segmented into various microservices to enhance agility
and performance. This often increases complexity, leading to inevitable issues
such as errors and latency. In this dynamic software landscape, Observability is
no longer a mere luxury; it is a necessity. Organizations initially gravitate
towards a particular tool for its ease of use. Later, after investing a
significant amount of time and finances, if they choose to migrate, vendor
lock-in becomes a major concern as each tool adheres to its own standards.

However, when we encounter the term observability, our initial instinct is
usually to attribute it solely to SRE concerns. Upon closer examination, one may
realize that actually implementing observability is, in essence, more aligned
with the developer domain. During this session, we will discuss the importance
of observability and related challenges from a developer's perspective. The
discussion will cover typical architectures, ranging from the ease of
instrumenting our Python code to further data processing and the seamless export
of telemetry data for analysis. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of
the significance of observability and how integrating open-source frameworks
like OpenTelemetry promotes effective observability in a vendor-neutral way.
