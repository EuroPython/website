Our world is driven by technology and there are many reasons to teach our kids
how to code. For example, coding allows them to develop logical reasoning skills
and teaches attention to detail. Allowing children to discover how much fun
coding can be supports them in their development and opens many doors for their
future.

But when and how should we start coding with kids? This talk will approach the
question from a scientific perspective, looking into how children's brains
develop, how children learn and how to best teach them coding abilities. It will
answer important questions like "At what age can a child start coding?" or "What
are the benefits of learning to code?". It will also present possible starting
points, like learning platforms or tutorials.
