In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for general-purpose computing, extending beyond their traditional role in visual applications. This surge has been driven by the need to accelerate scientific simulations and now for training artificial intelligences across various domains, from medical image analysis to predicting new proteins. In a similar vein, Python's versatility has led to it become a highly used language in many fields, with performance increasingly becoming a consideration as programmers tackle more demanding challenges.

This presentation will look at some of Python-based software, tools, and frameworks which enable developers and researchers to make use of the power of GPU acceleration in their work. It will start with an overview of GPUs, what they are capable of and things to consider when using them. Higher-level domain-specific frameworks for data scientists, AI practitioners etc which allow utilisation of GPUs without specialist knowledge will be discussed. Then different programming models for deploying your own Python GPU-based applications are introduced. The talk will finish with some resources accessible to developers to assist in their journey to GPU acceleration.
