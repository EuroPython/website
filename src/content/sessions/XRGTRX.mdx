This talk presents Appeal, a new library for command-line parsing in Python. Appeal avoids the cumbersome APIs and repetition endemic to the currently prevalent libraries in this space by leveraging Python's own function call interface. This talk will familiarize the audience with Appeal, its motivation, its approach, and its expressive power, and show them how to use Appeal in their own programs.
