Open source has widely grown to allow different tech career paths to enhance projects with their skills & provide jobs for those interested in working with open source. Open source contribution programs provide & build interested persons' capacity to become professionals.

Active community participation helps enhance career growth.

Outreachy is a paid and remote internship OS program that empowers, grows talents, and prepares them for career growth. Outreachy provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living.
