Did you know that Python can be used to test foreign code, such as Java and C?
This enables writing tests for legacy code in a very few time, reducing development time and improving code coverage (e.g., using python frameworks to generate testcases for foreign code).
If you have C and Java services that communicates over the network, you can use python as a glue to anticipate some integration tests directly in python.
