Multimedia processing can be very complex, especially if you want to handle most of the available codecs and formats. Fortunately, we have FFMpeg - a "complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video". It is a great tool, but its CLI is quite complex and challenging to master unless you use it on a daily basis. During this talk, I will tell you what FFmpeg is and how to use it in Python without hurting yourself.
