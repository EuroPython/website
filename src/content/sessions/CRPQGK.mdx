The advancements of artificial intelligence in computer vision and natural language processing often make the headlines, but the subspace of musical AI is developing just as rapidly. Let’s take a dive into the research area of music information retrieval and see how Python enables some of its proudest achievements. You’ll learn about common MIR tasks and get ideas on how you can analyze, generate and interact with music using code, so you can start exploring right away! 
No music theory knowledge nor prior experience with MIR is expected.
