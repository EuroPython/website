Pymoo is an open source python framework with state-of-the-art optimisation and post performance analysis capabilities. It provides an object oriented interface to solve constrained Single/Multi-Objective optimisation problems with a catalog of algorithms, customisations and post-optimisation evaluation functionalities. With additional features like Visualisation of optimal pareto-fronts, decision making, parallelization and customised sampling, Pymoo promises to be highly valuable for scalable optimisation solutions.
