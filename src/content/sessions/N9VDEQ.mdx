Have you heard we've got a nice new REPL in 3.13? Let's make some music with it in real time. You've had an intense conference. How about you sit back and relax and watch a music performance constructed before your very eyes? We'll be interacting with hardware synthesizers and drum machines, and even showing visualizations, but most importantly we will be writing Python, lots of Python. Consider it a demo of PyREPL and some other features of Python 3.13.
