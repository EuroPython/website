The new pyproject.toml file gains in popularity. Together with it, some changed
to existing packaging tools are happening, especially to setuptools and
distutils. The first one is moving away from setup.py support, and the other one
was removed from stdlib and merged into the setuptools itself.

But that change isn't scary or bad! Come to my poster and I'll show you how you
can migrate away from setup.py while still using setuptools like nothing ever
changed!
