✨ We are running mentored sprints for diverse community members at EuroPython this year ✨

👉🏽 Apply to be a mentor on the day or feature your open source project: email [cheuk@europython.eu](mailto:cheuk@europython.eu)

👉🏽 Apply to participate as a contributor (sprint on the day): [fill in this form](https://forms.gle/56EbHh4g19Mevo9i8).

If you are not a member of an underrepresented group of the community and want to take on the sprint we encourage you to bring someone from an underrepresented group with you.

👉🏽Volunteer for our Git Helpdesk (4 volunteers needed): Help new contributors with git/GitHub, such as cloning repo, creating branch, committing, resolving merge conflicts. [fill in this form](https://forms.gle/56EbHh4g19Mevo9i8)
