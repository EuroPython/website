There are many tutorials teaching how to use LLMs, this one focusses on how to build such systems from scratch in Python using all Open Source models and frameworks:

Large Language Models (LLMs) are still relatively new compared to ""Traditional ML"" techniques and have many new ideas as best practises that differ from training ML models.

In this workshop, you will learn the tips and tricks of creating and fine-tuning LLMs along with implementing cutting edge ideas of building these systems from the best research papers.
