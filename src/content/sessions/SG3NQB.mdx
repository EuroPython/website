The emergence of ChatGPT has led to an exponential growth of prospects and implementations in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Various teams were struck with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and hastened to incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their products. By using OpenAI models (text-curie-001, davinci, gpt-3.5-turbo), we successfully integrated them into our production on March 2, granting our users the ability to receive text summaries in their email reports and comprehend the essence of any article within our application. Three weeks later, we trained our own large language model for the same purpose. This talk will delve into our journey, exploring the lessons and insights gleaned from our hands-on experience with these cutting-edge tools.
