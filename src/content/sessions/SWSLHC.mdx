You _**don't**_ know comprehensions!

Why are list comprehensions good?
Because they are fast?

Wrong!

Because they are short?

Wrong!

This poster session will show why list comprehensions are an excellent Python tool.

The poster session will:
 - teach you to convert loops to list comprehensions;
 - show how to write list comprehensions from scratch; and
 - give 10+ actionable tips and tricks for list comprehensions.

The poster will also show the similarities between list comprehensions and:
 - set comprehensions;
 - dict comprehensions; and
 - generator expressions.
