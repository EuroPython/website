As developers, we learn early on that it’s important to focus on getting our code to work without unnecessarily pre-optimizing, but how do we learn to eventually optimize our code? What do we look for? How do you know when something is slow? How do you **do** something about it?

In this talk, we’ll discuss why your application performance matters, how you can learn to identify what matters most to you, and how Sentry has you in mind so you can effectively spend time improving the performance of critical user flows in your application.
