We created the “data load tool” (dlt), an open-source Python library, to bridge the gap between data engineers and data scientists. In this talk you will learn about how dlt can help you overcome typical roadblocks in your data science workflows, and how it streamlines the transition from data exploration to production. We will also discuss the pains of maintaining data pipelines and how dlt can help you to avoid common engineering headaches.

Join us to learn best practices around data handling and managing failures with real-life examples!
