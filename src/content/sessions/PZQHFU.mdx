This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to LocalStack - the leading platform to develop and test cloud applications entirely on your local machine!

LocalStack provides a set of 70+ AWS services, running in a local Docker container. The hugely popular open source project (46k+ Github stars, 130+ million downloads) is today considered a “must-have” in the toolbox of every AWS cloud developer around the globe.

Outline:
(1) Intro to AWS cloud development with Python
(2) Developing Python cloud apps with LocalStack
(3) Advanced integrations for IaC and CI/CD pipelines
(4) Python internals & advanced features in LocalStack
(5) Summary and wrap-up

This interactive session covers live coding to showcase common use cases, settings for local debugging of Lambdas and containerized apps, as well as advanced features that can radically improve team collaboration. We'll also glance over the large ecosystem of tools & integrations - including Terraform, Pulumi, CDK, Serverless.
