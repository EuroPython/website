Python offers decorator to implement re-usable code for cross-cutting task.
The support the separation of cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching,
or checking of permissions.
This can improve code modularity and maintainability.

This tutorial is an in-depth introduction to decorators.
It covers the usage of decorators and how to implement simple and more advanced
decorators.
Use cases demonstrate how to work with decorators.
In addition to showing how functions can use closures to create decorators,
the tutorial introduces callable class instance as alternative.
Class decorators can solve problems that use be to be tasks for metaclasses.
The tutorial provides uses cases for class decorators.

While the focus is on best practices and practical applications, the tutorial
also provides deeper insight into how Python works behind the scene.
After the tutorial participants will feel comfortable with functions that take
functions and return new functions.
