Thread safety is often overlooked when we start with Python for developing
simple scripts. But the hidden monster will be unleashed when we try to run
non-thread safe code in a multithreaded setup.

We will discuss the problems which can happen when seemingly good code is run in
a multithreaded environment. We will walk over the concept of race coditions,
how Pythonâ€™s GIL currently affects multithreading and will cover steps to fix
thread unsafe code using synchronization primitives.
