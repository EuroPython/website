Whether using threads or task-based event loops, running code concurrently is not without its challenges. This talk takes a look at the features provided by the Python programming language to solve problems of synchronization when dealing with concurrently executing code.

Together we will take a look at the synchronization classes and functions provided by the Python threading and asyncio modules, what problems they aim to solve, and how we might use them effectively in our own code.
