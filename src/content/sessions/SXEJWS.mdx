Descriptors are not black magic and this practical tutorial will show you that.
In fact, you use descriptors every day and you don't even know it!

Through a series of practical, hands-on exercises, you will learn

 - how to create a descriptor;
 - how to use the dunder methods `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__set_name__`;
 - what the descriptor protocol is; and
 - where descriptors show up in day-to-day Python code.
