title: GraalPy - A Fast Python Implementation
track: Python Internals & Ecosystem
tweet: GraalPy, the fast @GraalVM-based implementation of Python is ready for you!
  And it might just make your programs run faster or your integration with other languages
  leaner :)

GraalPy is the fast Python implementation built on GraalVM. We are 4x faster than CPython on the official Python Performance Benchmark Suite. We run PyTorch and Tensorflow and ML models from Huggingface.co. We execute the test suites of the top 600 PyPI packages every day and are the most compatible alternative implementation of Python to date. We can JIT pure Python code to the same speed as code [rewritten in Cython](https://twitter.com/timfelgentreff/status/1760597779250839820).

In this talk, we want to show what's possible today with GraalPy and why you might choose it for your projects: for it's performance, integration with other languages, or sandboxing and distribution features.
