title: GraalPy - Fast Python Implementation
track: Python Internals & Ecosystem
tweet: GraalPy, the fast @GraalVM-based implementation of Python is ready for you!
  And it might just make your programs run faster or your integration with other languages
  leaner :)

GraalPy is the fast Python implementation built on GraalVM. We run PyTorch and TensorFlow and ML models from Huggingface.co. We execute the test suites of the top 600 PyPI packages every day and are the most compatible alternative implementation of Python to date. We can JIT pure Python code to the same speed as code [rewritten in Cython](https://twitter.com/timfelgentreff/status/1760597779250839820). We are the most seamless and performant choice for integration with Java in both directions, including Jython compatibility mode.

In this talk, we want to show what's possible today with GraalPy and why you might choose it for your projects: for its performance, integration with Java and other languages, or sandboxing and distribution features.
