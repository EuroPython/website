title: We can get more from spatial, GIS and public domain datasets!
track: 'PyData: Machine Learning, Stats (2023)'
tweet: 'Geostatistics is the nice tool for every #DataScientist. We can use it to
  interpolate observations at unseen locations... and get more insights into processes
  where neighbourhood has its meaning.'

- Are prices of short-term rental apartments in your region similar? How similar are they, and at which distance do they tend to be correlated?
- Do you have access to a few air pollution measurements but must provide a smooth map over the whole area?
- Is your machine learning model based on remote sensing data from Earth Observation satellites, and do you want to include data sampled on Earth?
- Do you work with county-level socio-economic factors, but you want to get insights at a finer scale?

`if any(answer)`, then come and see what we can do with the `pyinterpolate` package designed exactly for spatial interpolation!
