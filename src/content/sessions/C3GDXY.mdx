Python 3.11 is considerably faster than 3.10.
How did we do that? And how are we going to make 3.12 and following releases even faster?

 In this talk, I will present a high level overview of the approach we are taking to speeding up CPython. Starting with a simple overview of some basic principles, I will show how we can apply those to streamline and speedup CPython. I will try to avoid computer science and software engineering terminology, in favor of diagrams, a few simple examples, and some high-school math. Finally, I make some estimates about how much faster the next few releases of CPython will be, and how much faster Python could go.
