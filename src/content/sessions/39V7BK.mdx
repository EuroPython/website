Building complex software projects is hard, but the fun part of doing it
is that it often pushes you to find non-obvious solutions to problems
which seem radical at first, yet almost obvious in hindsight.  In this
talk you learn some of the unusual Python tricks that we use at EdgeDB
to write more efficient Python with fewer bugs, and which you can apply in
your project next time you need to scratch a similar itch.
