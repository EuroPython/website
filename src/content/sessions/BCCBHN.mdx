You always wanted to learn programming, but setting it all up felt too intimidating, and the example code was boring? Why not try doing it with a handheld game console that already has everything installed, so you can just start writing the code right away without installing anything on your computer? And why not write some simple video games, like Snake, Tetris, or Flappy Bird? Thanks to the magic of CircuitPython you can now do that. We will walk you step by step through writing a simple video game on 8x8 pixel display. You will learn the basics of programming such as loops, conditionals, handling input and drawing to the screen, all without having to install anything on your laptop.

To participate, you will need a laptop or tablet with a USB socket (and an OTG adapter for the tablets), and any text editor (we recommend https://codewith.mu/). A micro-USB cable will be useful too, but we will have some if you didn't bring yours.
