Do you know what *RPA* means? Or *TDD*? Or "embedded"? At least, for sure, you know what **Python** is ðŸ˜‰.

"RPA" stands for "Robotic Process Automation", whereas "TDD" stands for "Test Driven Development". Those words usually refer to either the testing process or the automation of it. In the embedded world - the microcontroller one - it is usually easy to test features unitarily, but **hard to test them working within a bigger system**.

Therefore... What is this everything about? In this talk [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is introduced as the tool to integrate almost everything! Firstly, [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is introduced: Explain its purpose, semantics, basic writing, etc. Then, we will dig a little into it and how to maximize its potential by tweaking the internal libraries and writing our own ones. Next, we will simulate a real embedded device which we require some integration testing: Exchange some messages, evaluate an external request, etc. And finally, we will glue all this together with [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)!

Sounds interesting, right? Jump into this initialization talk for you to get introduced - or acquire more knowledge - into the embedded and testing world.
