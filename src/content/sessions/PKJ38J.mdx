Do you know what _RPA_ means? Or _TDD_? Or "embedded"? At least, for sure, you
know what **Python** is ðŸ˜‰.

"RPA" stands for "Robotic Process Automation", whereas "TDD" stands for "Test
Driven Development". Those words usually refer to either the testing process or
the automation of it. In the embedded world - the microcontroller one - it is
usually easy to test features unitarily, but **hard to test them working within
a bigger system**.

Therefore... What is this everything about? In this talk
[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is introduced as the tool to
integrate almost everything! Firstly,
[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is introduced: Explain its
purpose, semantics, basic writing, etc. Then, we will dig a little into it and
how to maximize its potential by tweaking the internal libraries and writing our
own ones. Next, we will simulate a real embedded device which we require some
integration testing: Exchange some messages, evaluate an external request, etc.
And finally, we will glue all this together with
[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)!

Sounds interesting, right? Jump into this initialization talk for you to get
introduced - or acquire more knowledge - into the embedded and testing world.
