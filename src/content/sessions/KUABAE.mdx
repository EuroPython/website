**Python** is an increasingly used language and the number of potential contributors is growing increasingly.

**Newcomers** to the community have a lot of documentation to guide them to transform from mere users to contributors.

There are many ways to **contribute** to Python or one of its packages or frameworks, and we will try to see some of them together.

In this talk, new Python developers will discover new ways to get involved in the community, and **community members** will get ideas for getting new people involved.
