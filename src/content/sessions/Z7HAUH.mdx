In a world, full of Micro-Services, distributing tasks is a constant challenge, and there's only one tool that can rule them all.

In this workshop, we'll introduce Celery - a tool for distributing tasks in an easy, fast, and flexible manner, and take you from zero to hero!
- We're going to understand why we need a distributed task system, and why to choose Celery.
- We'll write our first Celery task.
- Understand how to configure and run Celery.
- Familiarize ourselves with Celery's fundamental concepts.
- Dive into celery customizable options.
- Finally, we'll see a real-life example of how we used Celery in our production system and how we customized it to fit our needs, and discuss how you can do the same.
