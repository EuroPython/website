The Python C API is used to extend Python and make C libraries accessible in Python. The C API changes often forcing C extensions maintainers to update frequently their code. Also, new binary packages have to be build for each Python version. The stable ABI provides a more stable C API and only require to distribute a single binary package for all Python versions.
