"Oh, legal is boring," most developer community thinks in this line. Yes, it is boring, but it is essential at the same time. We will demystify certain basic legal concepts the developers need to know to secure them, their code, and, most importantly, the consequences of their steps. I will go through three fundamental pillars of Intellectual property laws: Trademark, Copyright, and Patent. The talk will include real-life examples of applying all of the above. This talk targets developers and not legal experts.
