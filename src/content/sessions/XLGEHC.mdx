In today's world, where disability affects a significant percentage of the
population, it is crucial for open-source communities to address the challenges
faced by persons with disabilities (PWDs) and work towards their inclusion. This
talk will delve into practical measures such as referral programs, internal
disability disclosures, and integrating disability into existing agendas rather
than treating it as a separate issue. We will dive into disability mainstreaming
with a focus on its role in promoting universal design and inclusivity.
Attendees will gain insights into establishing disability mainstreaming
committees, formulating action plans, implementing best practices, and
monitoring and evaluating progress.
