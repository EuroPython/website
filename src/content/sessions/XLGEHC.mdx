In today's world, where disability affects a significant percentage of the population, it is crucial for open-source communities to address the challenges faced by persons with disabilities (PWDs) and work towards their inclusion. This talk will delve into practical measures such as referral programs, internal disability disclosures, and integrating disability into existing agendas rather than treating it as a separate issue. We will dive into disability mainstreaming with a focus on its role in promoting universal design and inclusivity. Attendees will gain insights into establishing disability mainstreaming committees, formulating action plans, implementing best practices, and monitoring and evaluating progress.
