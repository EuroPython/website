Come meet the folks who make the Python programming language!

A panel discussion of core Python developers will take place on Wednesday at 2pm. Hear what's on their mind, what they're working on, and what the future holds for Python.

The panel will include:
* sitting Steering Council member Pablo Galindo Salgado;
* cybersecurity expert and aspiring core developer Marta Gómez Macías who made f-strings much better in 3.12;
* CPython's Windows expert Steve Dower;
* Red Hat veteran and emeritus Steering Council member Petr Viktorin;
* and the tech lead of Microsoft's "Faster Python" team Dr. Mark "HotPy" Shannon.

The panel will be chaired by Łukasz "Any-color-you-like-as-long-as-it's-black" Langa.
