Python prides itself on its 'batteries included' philosophy, but beyond the well-trodden modules lie hidden gems awaiting discovery. This talk ventures into the depths of the Python standard library to unearth lesser-known features from itertools, collections, functools, typing and more.

All of these tools are already built into every standard python installation and no "(uv) pip install" is necessary.

Many if not all of those are likely already known to old fashioned pythonistas, but for beginners (1-2years) there will be something new to learn, while for intermediate python developers there might be at least a few more gems to discover.

By delving into these underutilized modules, attendees will gain a richer understanding of Python's built-in capabilities and learn how to write more pythonic code.
