[**Apache Airflow**](https://github.com/apache/airflow) is an Open Source workflow orchestrator. It is a python library that allows you to automate complex code and integrate it with a plethora of Data Sources. It is provided with an integrated UI and API for both your human and programmatic needs.

After 5 years of running Airflow in production, I hope to share some insights on the technology. The strengths and weaknesses, recommended features and more dangerous ones, and similar considerations on the UI.

I'll also be talking about how **you** can make your own *Operators* in Airflow.

Come take a deeper dive into the same solution used by Airbnb, Slack, Walmart and many more to efficiently run their data pipelines.
