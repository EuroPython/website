_[PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) is a platform for Python in the browser_, enabled by [web-assembly](https://webassembly.org/). It brings the rich ecosystems of [CPython](https://python.org/) and [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) to the web. _[Invent](https://invent-framework.github.io/) is a PyScript based app creation framework with complementary browser based tooling_ and is designed to be easy to learn and use, no matter if you're a beginner or expert.

This talk introduces Invent, explains how it was built on top of PyScript and describes the design and architecture decisions made to ensure Python and the browser complement each other. Invent apps work anywhere a browser works and by the end of this presentation you'll be armed with all you need to know to build, deploy and extend native Python based applications running atop PyScript on all manner of platforms (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, [web-enabled fridge](https://www.standard.co.uk/shopping/esbest/home-garden/kitchen-appliances/best-smart-fridges-b1002542.html), [car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkhbN9B9bbs), point of sale terminal... you name it, so long as there's a browser!).

This talk will be fast-paced, technical, creative, full of possibilities, may include geese ðŸª¿, _and will be a lot of geeky fun_.

By the end you'll ask yourself, "I wonder what I can invent?" and go create cool stuff in minutes.
