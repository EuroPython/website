This tutorial presents sktime - a unified, open source framework for machine learning with time series in python. sktime provides interfaces to algorithms of various types, and modular tools for pipelining, composition, and tuning. You will learn how identify your learning task, and how to build, use, and evaluate different algorithms on real-world data sets.
