tweet: "pip install malware: it\u2019s that simple. Did you know how easy it can be\

pip install malware: itâ€™s that easy. Almost all projects depend on external packages, but did you know how easy it can be to install something nasty instead of the dependency you want? I'll be showing this live, as I make malware and install it from PyPI onto my own computer during the talk!
