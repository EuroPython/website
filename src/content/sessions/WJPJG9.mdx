The C API has many different stakeholders, including but not limited to CPython core developers, maintainers of Python extensions, code generators (Cython, pybindy11, etc) and alternative API design (HPy).

The main goal of this summit is to make sure that people from all these different projects can meet and discuss about the state of the C API, existing challenges and ongoing work.
