What it’s like to keep the lights on in a rapidly growing business - how we’ve scaled our metrics, logging and tracing beyond processing 50TB+ of telemetry a day, and what we’ve learned along the way.

During this session, we will discuss the challenges of scaling high load services, and give few pointers to developers to help your chosen open-source observebility tool function as a product.
