# Speaker Mentorship Programme

As a diverse and inclusive community EuroPython offers support for potential
speakers who want help preparing for their contribution. To achieve this, we
are running the Speaker Mentorship Programme again.

The Speaker Mentorship signups are now closed. We’re thrilled to have matched 44 mentees with 24 mentors from our community. A huge thank you to our mentors, and best of luck to the mentees — we can’t wait to see your submissions!

## 1. One-to-One Mentorship Programme

A mentee needing help with their proposal will be matched with an experienced
mentor. The mentor's job is to facilitate and support the mentee so they are
able to contribute to EuroPython with confidence. A mentor serves as the guide,
supporter and source of help to the mentee; they are not expected to tell the
mentee what their contribution should be (that's for the mentee to decide).

## Mentors

We expect mentors to have past speaking experience at conferences similar to
EuroPython.

For mentors who take on a mentee, we expect you to provide 4 one-hour sessions
with your mentee to:

- Prepare their CfP submission.
- Review their CfP before submission.
- If your mentee is selected, help them prepare the talk. Otherwise, help them
  submit their talk to another meetup/conference should they wish to.
- Help them rehearse for their talk.

You will also be invited to join the panel of the Webinar Workshops.

If you require help contributing to EuroPython, especially if you are from an
underrepresented or a marginalised group in the tech industry, you are welcome
to submit your application in the form below to become a mentee.

## 2. Workshops

### Online Event: First Time Speaker’s Workshop
After the CfP, we will host an online panel session with 2–3 experienced community members sharing advice for first-time and returning speakers. At the end of the panel, there will be a QnA session to answer all the participants' questions.

**Date**: TBD

**Time**: 60-90 mins (depending on the amount of questions)
