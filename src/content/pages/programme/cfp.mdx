EuroPython reflects the colourful and diverse backgrounds, cultures and interests of our community, so you (yes, you!) should go for it: propose something and represent!

No matter your level of Python or public speaking experience, EuroPython’s job is to help you bring yourself to our community so we all flourish and benefit from each other’s experience and contribution.

If you’re thinking, “but they don’t mean me”, then we especially mean **YOU**.

* If you’re from a background that isn’t usually well-represented in most Python groups, get involved-we want to help you make a difference.
* If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most Python groups, get involved—we want your help making a difference.
* If you’re worried about not having enough technical knowledge, get involved—your fresh perspective will be invaluable.
* If you think you’re an imposter, join us—many of the EuroPython organisers feel this way.
* This is a volunteer-led community, so join us—you will be welcomed with friendship, support and compassion.

To get some inspiration for talk ideas, check out the [tracks](https://ep2025.europython.eu/programme/tracks/) we're running this year. We also run a [mentorship program](https://ep2025.europython.eu/programme/mentorship/) to help people with their proposals: we'd love to hear from you if you want to sign up as a mentor or mentee.

Finally, you can find out more about the [selection process](https://ep2025.europython.eu/programme/selection/) all talks go through after submission.

## How to write a proposal

You’ve come up with a fantastic idea for your EuroPython session, but when it’s time to write the proposal, inspiration seems to vanish! Writing a compelling proposal that effectively conveys your idea can be challenging, even for seasoned speakers. To help you out, we've compiled a set of tips to help you to structure your proposal and present your ideas in a way that will engage both the session committee and your potential audience. And if you prefer video to written instructions, you can also check out our video below, which covers all the same tips!

### What problem does your session address?

As engineers, it’s easy to get carried away about the solutions—after all, they’re the most exciting part! But if you want your proposal to stand out, it’s far more impactful to begin with the problem you aim to solve. Starting with the problem helps you connect with your audience, drawing them in by addressing challenges they may have faced or intriguing them with an unexpected application of Python.

### Why is this interesting to the Python community?

To make your proposal truly compelling, it’s not enough to just present a problem—you need to sell it. Why is this problem worth your audience's attention? Does it address a widespread challenge in the Python community, like performance optimisation or effective monitoring? Or perhaps it sheds light on a niche, unexpected issue that others would find fascinating. Maybe your idea showcases a creative or delightful application of Python, sparking a sense of fun and wonder. Reflect on what drew you to this idea initially, and strive to convey that excitement to your audience.

### What's your perspective on this problem?

Now it’s time to showcase your unique perspective on the problem. What fresh insight or contribution do you bring to the discussion? Maybe you’ve devised an innovative way to use Python to tackle a well-known challenge—or even developed an entire package. Perhaps you’re passionate about breaking down a complex Python concept into something easily understandable. Or maybe you’re issuing a call-to-action to address a pressing issue within the language or community. Whatever your angle, this is your opportunity to highlight your distinctive take.

### What will the audience take away?

To wrap up your proposal, clearly articulate what attendees will gain from your session—after all, this is the main reason they’ll choose to attend! Reflect on everything you discovered while developing your idea, and identify a few key takeaways you want to share. By highlighting these insights, you’ll give your audience a clear sense of the value your session offers-and increase not only your chances of getting a session into the conference, but also filling the room!

As you can see, strong proposals are built around a clear and compelling narrative. They guide your audience through why you decided to explore a particular problem, how you approached solving it, and what valuable insights they can gain from your work. When thinking about the length of your proposal, try to strike a balance between being concise and including enough detail to get all of the above across. Check out [last year's successful proposals](https://ep2024.europython.eu/sessions) to get an idea of what this looks like.

### Additional tips

#### Focus on open source projects

As a community-driven conference, we prioritise sessions that highlight open-source Python projects over paid solutions. If your company is interested in showcasing a paid product during a session, we offer dedicated sponsored talk slots. We encourage you to reach out to our sponsorship team at sponsoring@europython.eu to explore how you can secure one of these opportunities.

#### Planning on submitting a tutorial?

Building on feedback from previous years, this year we’re emphasising tutorials with a strong, hands-on component. In your proposal, please outline how you plan to incorporate active coding sections in your tutorial.

### 45 minute talks

We have a very limited number of 45-minute talk slots available, and some speakers may be asked to adjust their planned 45-minute proposal to fit a 30-minute slot. If you’re able to make this adjustment, please let the selection committee know how you would modify your talk. You can include this information in the Notes section of the Call for Proposals (CfP).

### Poster guidelines

Posters are a graphical way for to showcase your research, project or technology. Posters are exhibited at the conference, read at any time by participants, and can be discussed face-to-face with their authors during the poster sessions between 16th and 18th July. Posters should be designed to be printed in DIN A0.
