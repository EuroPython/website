## Exhibition

We have compiled all exhibition related information below.

We provide a lockable counter to all exhibitors and advise everyone to store valuable goods in the locker
overnight, or when the booth is unstaffed, just to have the peace of mind. EuroPython organisers are not
responsible for any lost items.

The EuroPython Society will take out public liability insurance for the event but are not responsible for
any damages caused by the sponsors in the exhibit area or goods ordered from the booth builder.
We encourage you to take out separate insurance when possible.

### Exhibition Schedule

**Exhibit Days**: during the three main conference days: **Wednesday to Friday, 10-12 July, 2024**

**Exhibit Hours**:
- Wednesday & Thursday (10-11 July): 9:00-17:00
- Friday (12 July): 09:00 - 16:00

All booths should be staffed at least during the official breaks. It is highly
recommended that they will be staffed throughout the opening hours, especially
the more prominent ones, such as Keystone, Diamond and Platinum.

### Exhibit Booths

If you cannot come to the venue to set up on Tuesday, you are welcome to do
so on Wednesday at 08:00. Please note that during the live event, schedule

updated in the sponsor-lounge channel on our Discord conference community.

distribute them at your booth. We strongly encourage you to distribute gifts
made of environmentally friendly materials, to focus on quality rather than
quantity to reduce waste.
