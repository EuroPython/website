# EuroPython 2024 Sprints

EuroPython 2024 Sprints will be during the weekend 13-14 July. This year, we are
hosting the sprint weekend at a **different venue** from the main conference and it will be free for
anyone to join!

As per our tradition, the conference organisers will provide the rooms and
facilities but the sprints are organised by **YOU**. It is a great chance to
contribute to open-source projects large and small, learn from each other, geek
out and have fun. üêç

Lunch and coffee will be provided.

**When**: 13-14 July 2024 (09:30 - 17:00)

**Where**: Rajska Building (RB),
[≈Ωi≈ækov Campus, V≈†E](https://www.vse.cz/english/about-vse/profile/campus/)
(Prague University of Economics and Business)

- **sprint rooms** - all on the 1st floor of RB
- **chillout area**: the
  [atrium](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qKwC7fmxupRINP5Pvj6Npe_eq0czI6Y/view?usp=sharing)
  on the ground floor of RB

**Who can attend**:

- If you have an in-person EuroPython ticket
  ([Conference, Tutorial or Combined](/tickets#ticket-types)), then access to the
  sprints is already included. Remember to select your sprints attendance when
  buying / configuring your ticket, to let the organisers know.
- If you do not have an in-person conference ticket, you can register to join
  the sprints for free. Registration information will be announced soon
  [here](/tickets).

## Location of the sprints venue
The Rajska Building (RB), [≈Ωi≈ækov Campus, V≈†E](https://maps.app.goo.gl/azRTAczu8B5ma1XFA) (Prague University of Economics and Business) is the home of our sprints again this year.

<MapSprints></MapSprints>

<address>
n√°m. Winstona Churchilla 1938<br/>
130 00 Praha 3-≈Ωi≈ækov, Czechia<br/>
</address>

You can use the [≈Ωi≈ækov Campus Map, V≈†E (PDF)](https://www.vse.cz/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/page/1000/planek_en.pdf) to help guide you. The entrance to the building can be recognised by the inscription "Vysok√° ≈°kola ekonomick√° v Praze" above it.

### How to get there?

- **By bus**: The nearest bus stop is N√°mƒõst√≠ Winstona Churcilla (line 135) or Viktoria ≈Ωi≈ækov (lines 101, 123, 135, 175, 176). If you disembark at N√°mƒõst√≠ Winstona Churchilla, the entrance is directly across from the stop on Italsk√° Street.
- **By tram**: Viktoria ≈Ωi≈ækov station (lines 26, 5, 9) is a 5-10 minute walk. Proceed along Seifertov√° Street, pass through the park (Pomn√≠k Winstona Churchilla on Google Maps), then reach Italsk√° Street. A short uphill walk of about one to two minutes, and the entrance will be on your left.
- **By metro**: Start from Hlavn√≠ N√°dra≈æ√≠ station (C line). After exiting the metro, ascend to the first floor (not the ground level) and turn left, following signs for the North platform (in Czech: Sever). Continue through the tunnel, ascend the escalators, and climb another set of stairs. You'll then find yourself on Italsk√° Street, facing a large building - that's the V≈†E building. Proceed uphill on Italsk√° for a minute or two, and you'll see the entrance right there.

## What is a ‚ÄúSprint‚Äù ?

‚ÄúSprints‚Äù, or ‚Äúhackathons‚Äù, are a form of impromptu coding meetups where anyone
interested in a project can come together for a short period of time to make
quick progress, share knowledge and ideas, and solve problems together. The
two-day sprint is the perfect way to end the full-week EuroPython conference,
giving you a hands-on experience to solidify what you have learned and bond over
the love for coding, making and problem solving.

## New to a "Sprint"?

You may want to come to the [Mentored Sprint](/mentored-sprint) on Friday before going to the actual sprint! Mentored Sprint is tailored to beginners who have not contributed to open-source before. We will have mentors who will be there to help you and give you a head start of your contributing journey.

## Organising a Sprint

**Sprint rooms**: we will have 11 rooms in total for the sprints, all of which
are on the 1st floor of the Rajska Building (RB) of V≈†E. Check out the
[room layout](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N2Q_jB3j4LRXS15WJI2STlXvBkGABbgC/view?usp=sharing)
for details. The rooms 103-107 and 112-116 each have the capacity for 24 and
look like
[this (img)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J2ffugSUZcx4oZO6LGMsUjPL1Z2ZrWw1/view?usp=sharing).
Room 109 has capacity for 48 and looks like
[this (img)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVOMcF5IxSGH4TgpDoby1bEQDBMLWhhP/view?usp=sharing).

**Note**: As each room might have the capacity to host multiple sprints, it is
recommended that sprint organisers prioritise proposing their sprints in already
designated rooms that have sufficient space to accommodate the expected number
of participants.
