# Programme


Welcome to the 23rd EuroPython. We’re the oldest and longest-running volunteer-led Python programming conference on the planet! Join us in July in the vibrant Bohemian city of Prague. We’ll be together, celebrating our shared passion for Python and its community!

A week of all things Python:

* Monday & Tuesday, 8 & 9 July: Tutorials & Workshops
* Wednesday–Friday, 10–12 July: Conference talks & sponsor exhibition
* Saturday & Sunday, 13 & 14 July: Sprints


## Monday & Tuesday, 8 & 9 July

First two days are dedicated to the Tutorials and Workshops.

We start at 9:00 a.m. at the [PCC](/where#prague-congress-centre---conference-venue). On the first two days, all activities will take place on the first floor only.

We are hosting [16 tutorials](/tutorials), and two special beginner workshops: [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/prague/) on Monday and [Humble Data](https://humbledata.org/) on Tuesday.

PyBurger is happening on Monday! We will all meet up at Burgerman & enjoy one of the best burgers in Europe.

Two Summits – [C-API Summit](/session/c-api-summit) on Monday, and [WASM Summit](/session/wasm-summit) on Tuesday.

**Keep in mind that in order to attend the Tutorials you need a [Tutorial or Combined](/tickets/#ticket-types) ticket. Summits and workshops require a separate registration.**

Spaces are limited, so act fast. :)

If you are a speaker, we are also hosting a [Speaker's Dinner](/speakers-dinner) on Tuesday.

## Wednesday–Friday, 10-12 July

After the opening session on Wednesday, we will start with the first of the [6 Keynote talks](/keynoters).

Then, for the next three days, you can enjoy more than [110 Talks](/talks) running in 6 parallel tracks, and [9 Posters](/posters) presented during lunch breaks in the expo area.

All the main conference activities occur on those three days. On top of that, you can visit our [Sponsor Exhibition](/sponsor) and any of the other extra Events, including a [Social Event](/social-event) on Thursday.

On Thursday, 11th July we have Pyladies lunch & a range of events aimed at fostering community and empowerment among women in tech. More information can be found [here](/pyladies-events).

On Friday, 12th July we have a Community Organiser's Lunch that includes an open Space discussion about Python Organisations and how we deal with challenges! You can sign up for the session [here](https://forms.gle/xFDN6ZLkLoF8s3RXA).

Set sail on Friday with us for a scenic boat trip to enjoy an evening of networking and relaxation. Make sure to reserve your spot early! Sign-up will be available soon.


## Saturday & Sunday, 13 & 14 July

For Saturday and Sunday, we will switch to a different venue: [The Rajska Building (RB), Žižkov Campus, VŠE (Prague University of Economics and Business)](sprints#location-of-the-sprints-venue), which is more suitable for [Sprints](/sprints).

As per our tradition, the conference organisers will provide the rooms and
facilities, but the sprints are organised by YOU. It is a great chance to
contribute to open-source projects large and small, learn from each other, geek
out, and have fun.
