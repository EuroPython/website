# Programme


Welcome to the 23rd EuroPython. We’re the oldest and longest running volunteer-led Python programming conference on the planet! Join us in July in the vibrant Bohemian city Prague. We’ll be together, celebrating our shared passion for Python and its community!

A week of all things Python:

* Monday & Tuesday, 8 & 9 July: Tutorials & Workshops
* Wednesday–Friday, 10-12 July: Conference talks & sponsor exhibition
* Saturday & Sunday, 13 & 14 July: Sprints


## Monday & Tuesday, 8 & 9 July

First two days are dedicated to the Tutorials and Workshops.

We start at 09:00am at the [PCC](/venue). On the first two days everything happens on the first floor only.

We have [16 tutorials](/tutorials), two special workshops: [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/prague/) on Monday and [Humble Data](https://humbledata.org/) on Tuesday.

Two Summits – [C-API Summit](/c-api-summit) on Monday, and [WASM Summit](/wasm-summit) on Tuesday.

**Keep in mind that in order to attend the Tutorials you need a [Tutorial or Combined](/tickets/#ticket-types) ticket. Summits and workshops have a separate registration.**

Spaces are limited so act fast :)

If you are one of the speakers, we are also going to host a [Speaker's Dinner](/speakers-dinner) on Tuesday.

## Wednesday–Friday, 10-12 July

Right after the opening session on Wednesday, we start with first of the [6 Keynotes](/keynotes).

Then for the next three days, you can enjoy [110 Talks](/talks) running in 6 parallel tracks, and [9 Posters](/posters) happening during lunch breaks in the expo area.

All the main conference activities happen on those three days. On top of that you can visit our [Sponsor Exhibition](/sponsor), any of the other extra [Events](/events), including a [Social Event](/social-event) on Thursday.


## Saturday & Sunday, 13 & 14 July

For Saturday and Sunday we switch to a different venue, more suitable for [Sprints](/sprints).

As per our tradition, the conference organisers will provide the rooms and
facilities but the sprints are organised by YOU. It is a great chance to
contribute to open-source projects large and small, learn from each other, geek
out and have fun.
