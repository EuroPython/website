## **Q. When and where is EuroPython 2025 taking place?**

A. EuroPython 2025 will take place on **14 â€“ 20 July 2025**. Mark your calendars!

The conference will return to **Prague, Czech Republic**, with the main conference hosted at the [Prague Congress Centre (PCC)](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage).

Need help getting around? Check out [how to navigate Prague](/where) and our volunteer-curated [Prague exploration tips](/explore).

## **Q. What will the schedule look like?**

A. The conference will be organised into three phases:

1. **Monday & Tuesday (14 & 15 July):** Tutorials & Workshops
2. **Wednesday â€“ Friday (16 â€“ 18 July):** Main Conference Days
3. **Saturday & Sunday (19 & 20 July):** Sprint Days

## **Q. What will the programme include?**

A. Expect a diverse programme with around **20 hands-on tutorials & workshops**, **120 talks**, and interactive discussions and events.

We aim to cover the many ways Python is used to solve problems and create exciting projects.

Curious about what to expect? Check out the [EP2024 programme](https://ep2024.europython.eu/schedule/) for inspiration.

We are always keen to hear new ideas on how to enrich the programme and other activities you are interested in oraganising.
Share your ideas with the programme team at [programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).

## **Q. When can I submit a talk proposal?**

A. The [Call for Proposals (CfP)](/programme/cfp) is open from **10 â€“ 27 January 2025**.

Need support with your submission? Explore our [Speaker Mentorship Programme](programme/mentorship/) for guidance.

## **Q. How are talks reviewed and selected?**

A. This year, the first **100 proposals** will be quickly screened by the programme team, and feedback for possible improvements will be provided.

Once the CfP closes, all proposals go through **community voting and two rounds of review and refinement** to finalise the programme.

Learn more about our selection process [here](/programme/selection/).


## **Q. What support is available for speakers?**
{/*
A. Accepted speakers receive a **free ticket**. Details about ticket for speakers will be shared later.

Speakers needing travel support are encouraged to apply for Financial Aid when applications open.

We actively support first-time speakers and welcome participation from under-represented groups in tech. Learn more through our [Speaker Mentorship Programme](/programme/mentorship).
