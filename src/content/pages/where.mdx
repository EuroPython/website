## Prague

<Image src={venueImage} width="1200" alt="" />

<br></br>

Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic. Sitting on the [Vltava River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6kqu2mk-Kw), the beautiful historic centre is a UNESCO world heritage site. There's a LOT to see, do and enjoy, in addition to the conference! The ancient [Vy≈°ehrad](https://www.vysehradtickets.com/vysehrad/) is just 10-min walk away from the conference venue. Not only is is an ancient fortress, but also a park with a great view of Prague Castle and the river. We hope you enjoy taking a walk with fellow Pythonistas in the tranquil park when you need a bit of peace from the buzz of the conference.

As per EuroPython tradition, we shall walk around, chat, laugh and explore the city together. Whether it is to enjoy the stunning view of the "[City of a Hundred Spires](https://www.prague.eu/en/articles/the-towers-of-prague-10537)" from any (or all!) of the 120+ towers, or standing still to admire the wonder of [Prague Astronomical Clock](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/3129/astronomical-clock?back=1). The only problem is being spoiled for choice!

In addition, Prague has an extensive and modern public transport system; its [public transport website](https://www.dpp.cz/en) will give you all the information you need.

The conference centre is adjacent to the Vy≈°ehrad - a short walk away from [N√°plavka](https://www.mmzoneblog.com/naplavka), full of cafes, pubs and restaurants, a wonderful area to relax by the river and take in the spirit of the city.
