## Grant Types

You can apply for three different types of grants:


1. **[Closed] Free Ticket Voucher Grant:** Get a voucher for a free standard ticket for
   the in-person conference.
2. **[Closed] Travel/Accommodation Grant:** We will reimburse travel and/or accommodation
   costs up to â‚¬400.
3. **[Closed] Visa Application Fee Grant:** Get reimbursed for the costs of a short-stay
   Schengen visa to the Czech Republic (up to â‚¬80).
4. **ðŸ†• Free remote ticket:** Get a remote ticket to join the conference remotely for free.


## Grant Eligibility

Our grants are open to everyone in need of financial support to participate in
EuroPython. We will look at the following criteria to help decide who qualifies
for a grant:

1. **Contributors:** We want to support those who make the Python community
   a positive, inclusive and welcoming space. We welcome grant applications
   from folks who need financial support and who clearly put effort into
   the community and EuroPython, including speakers, volunteers, community
   organizers, and open-source contributors.
2. **Social & Economic factors:** Everyone should have a chance to attend
   EuroPython, regardless of their social or economic situation.
3. **Diversity:** We want EuroPython to be the most diverse and inclusive event
   possible, and we especially want to help those from under-represented groups
   in tech feel welcomed, be present in and contribute to our community.


## How to apply

The sign up date for this year's Financial Aid has passed. Applicants for in-person attendance will be notified of acceptance/rejection
by 5 June, 2024. See timeline for details.

**Application for Financial Aid for Remote Tickets between 14 June to 1 July.**

The data we collect on this form will exclusively be used by our Financial Aid
team for the selection of grant recipients and the processing of financial
aid refunds. No data is passed on to third parties, except to our accountants
and the bank in order to process the refunds. We use Google Forms for the
processing and Google Drive for storing the relevant information.

For more details on our privacy policies, please see our
[privacy policy][privacy-policy].


## Timeline

Grants will be awarded in two rounds. This makes it easier for us to reallocate
grants in case grant offers were rejected in the first round. Receiving a grant
early is also beneficial for people having to apply for a Schengen visa.

If youâ€™ve applied for the first round, you will automatically be considered
during the second round if you did not receive a grant during the first round.
You do not have to reapply separately for the second round. **In fact, if you
want to increase your chances of receiving a grant, it is recommended to apply
early.**

You can also apply for a grant to participate remotely when the separate application is open.

**Note:** dates in the timeline follow the [Anywhere on Earth][AoE] convention.

## Grant Policies

### Policies for all grants

- Please note that all grants and grant offers are personal and
  non-transferable.

- You must accept a grant offer before the relevant acceptance deadline stated
  in the timeline. The grant offer will expire otherwise.

- The Financial Aid Team may also make grant offers outside the two main rounds
  of selection.

### ðŸ†• Free Remote Ticket

- You will receive an individual voucher code that you can use to claim a free remote conference ticket.

### [Closed] Free Ticket Voucher Grant

- You will receive an **individual voucher code** for a free **regular**
  conference ticket that gives you access to the three main conference days.

- If you have already purchased a ticket prior to being granted a free Financial Aid ticket voucher, please request a refund for the paid ticket separately before using the voucher to claim your free ticket. The Financial Aid programme cannot reimburse you the cost of tickets you previously paid for directly.

### [Closed] Travel/Accommodation Grant & Visa Application Fee Grant

If you received a travel/accommodation grant or a visa application fee grant,
you will be reimbursed **after the conference** via PayPal or bank transfer
(SEPA/Swift). We will only reimburse you after we've received your
receipt/invoices and a **photo of your conference badge**.

In addition, please pay close attention to the following:

- The total combined travel/accommodation grant cannot exceed â‚¬400, unless otherwise agreed.
- The Visa Application Fee Grant cannot exceed â‚¬80.
- Reimbursements will be made **after** the conference via PayPal or bank
  transfer (SEPA and Swift). Itâ€™s not possible to be reimbursed before the
  conference or by other means, such as cash.
- Note that we might experience difficulty transacting with certain countries
  due to sanctions or international regulations.
- Reimbursements will only be made after weâ€™ve received your
  travel/accommodation receipts/invoices. The deadline to submit your
  receipts/invoices is **21 July 2024** [Anywhere on Earth][AoE].
- Please make sure that your receipts/invoices contain the information necessary
  for us to validate them. At the very least, they should contain your name, the
  date, the amount, and specify what the receipt/invoice is for.
- Reimbursements will only be made to individuals who actually attended the
  conference. Please include a **photo of your conference badge** with your
  receipts/invoices.
- Please consider the risk of travel restrictions: choose flexible booking
  options that allow you to cancel in case you canâ€™t actually make it to the
  conference.
- If youâ€™ve applied for a grant or accepted a grant, but cannot make it to the
  conference, please contact us at [finaid@europython.eu][email-finaid] as soon as possible. This
  allows us to reallocate your grant to someone else.
