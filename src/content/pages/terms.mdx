# Terms & Conditions

These terms and conditions (“T&C”) apply to all attendees, sponsors and other
participants in the **EuroPython 2024 conference** (the “**Event**” or the
“**Conference**”).

The “**Organisers”** of the Event: the EuroPython Society (EPS), having the
registered address EuroPython Society, Ramnebacken 45, 424 38 Agnesberg, Sweden.

**Event Date**: 8 - 14 July 2024

**Event Place:** For the in-person event, the Prague Congress Centre (**
“PCC or the “Venue”**) in Prague, the Czech Republic. For the “**Online Event**”, a
combination of tools used for the online Conference defined as “**Online
Platform**”.

## 1. Registration

Registration for participation in the conference must be made via the Event
Website. After purchase, the participant will receive an email from the
Organisers as a confirmation of the acceptance of the purchase contract.

Each ticket is bound to a named participant which can be configured after the purchase.
They can be reassigned, but only the “Participant”, the person identified on the ticket,
is allowed to use the ticket. This also includes any URLs or passwords sent
out to the Participant, which allow access to online media used during the
Event.

Tickets may be subject to proper proof of eligibility (e.g. student ID or relevant
document). The Participants may be requested for such proof when picking up
the ticket badge at the conference registration desk or by the Organisers
during the Event. If eligibility cannot be proven, the ticket can be converted
into a standard or business ticket.

Some ticket categories only have a limited number of available tickets. The
number of tickets is determined by the Organisers at their sole discretion.

For in-person events, the tickets can be picked up as badges at the conference
registration desk on the first day of the Event. The badge permits access to the
conference venue during the Event Days, subject to the ticket category.

For an online event, the confirmation email represents the ticket. The Participant will
be granted access to the online media used during the online event.

## 2. Payments

Unless otherwise stated, all prices include the currently applicable VAT rates
as required by local and EU regulations.

Invoices can be downloaded via the URL in the order confirmation sent out via email,
upon successful payment.

Payments for the Event can only be made by debit or credit card. Payment against
invoice is only possible on a case-by-case basis, at the sole discretion of the Organisers.

For debit or credit card payments, the cards will be charged immediately
following the application. Debit and credit card payments are handled by the
service provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com). The Organisers do not store any
card information.

## 3. Performance and Cancellation

Admission to the Event is granted based on tickets (“Event Tickets” or
“Conference Passes”). The ticket fee listed on the Event Website covers the
admission to the Event (or part thereof) to the extent defined on the Event
Website for each ticket category. The same applies to any additional items which
may be sold as part of the Event, such as e.g. SIM cards, tickets for museums,
local transport, etc.

Changes to the programme, the event content, schedule and the speakers may occur
due to organisational reasons and are not considered as a breach of the purchase
contract. There is no right to refunds for any unused services which were
properly offered.

The Organisers are entitled to withdraw from the contract if carrying out the
Event would be uneconomic (e.g. due to insufficient number of exhibitors,
sponsors or participants). The same applies if the Event is cancelled, in whole
or in part, for reasons beyond their reasonable control, such as act of God,
labour disputes, civil commotion, pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, vandalism,
war, lack of power or utilities, floods, fire, acts of Government or regulatory
authorities or other events of such effect that carrying out or the continuation
of the event would be unreasonable in the circumstances. The Organisers are
under no obligation to reorganise the event.

In case of a cancellation of the Event, all participants will be notified by the
Organisers without delay and any payments made will be refunded. The Organisers’
liability is limited to refunding the participation fee. All other liability for
participant claims is excluded except in cases of wilful or gross negligence on
the part of the Organisers. In particular, no claims may be made for refund of
travel and accommodation costs, loss of working time or opportunity.

## 4. Refunds

The Event Tickets are fully refundable with no questions asked until
**June 7th, 2024 23:59:59 CEST** (the “Refund End Time”). Refunds are no longer
possible after that Refund End Time unless otherwise specified by the
Organisers. The Organisers reserve the right to deduct administrative costs
(bank, online payments services, etc) from the refund.

For in-person tickets, before June 7th, the participants can request a full refund
from the order details URL link in the order confirmation email. After June 7th,
special refund requests must be made by email to the
[refunds@europython.eu](mailto:refunds@europython.eu) email address. The email
must include the Order Code, Ticket IDs, name of the person who bought the
ticket and the special circumstances.

For remote tickets, refunds can be requested until June 18th by emailing
[refunds@europython.eu](mailto:refunds@europython.eu). After June 23rd, refund is not possible.

Refunds are processed via Stripe and will be paid back to the same
payment card which was used for the purchase of the tickets.

Processing of the refunds will happen no later than 30 days after the end of the
Event.

Alternatively, the ticket may be reassigned to another participant at no extra
cost. Where eligibility constraints apply (e.g. students), the substitute
participant must similarly provide the required proper proof of eligibility. If
proof is not sufficiently provided, the substitute participant must pay the
difference between the discounted ticket and the standard ticket price.

### Revocation Rights

Conference tickets are not subject to the
[EU regulations on distance selling and the 14-day cooling off period](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm).
Outside the above refund policy, we do not provide refunds on ticket purchases
after the Refund End Date.

## 5. Data Protection

The Organisers are considered data controllers under the terms of the
[Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=celex:32016R0679).

### Right of Denial

The Organisers hereby notifies that the Participant has the right to deny the

If desired, participants may revoke their consent to the use of their personal

email to: [privacy@europython.eu](mailto:privacy@europython.eu) or alternatively
writing a letter to the Organisers.

### Recordings and Photography

Participants may be photographed, filmed, or their voices recorded during the
Event. Such recordings may be published by the Organisers and/or used for
marketing purposes. Participation in the Event is conditional on the
Participant’s consent to this.

In applying to participate in the event, the Participant gives a declaration of
consent to video and audio recordings and photography during the Event and that
