# Accessibility at EuroPython

EuroPython ensures that it’s welcoming, accessible and inclusive for all our
guests attending the conference. If you have suggestions to improve
accessibility, let us know by contacting us at
[helpdesk@europython.eu](mailto:helpdesk@europython.eu).

## General

For enquiries, visit our helpdesk at registration or look for volunteers wearing
Yellow conference t-shirt when enquiring about accessibility which includes:

- Lifts
- Accessible toilet facilities
- Dietary requirements

At main talk rooms, enquire with the session chair before the talks about
designated seating, maintaining clear pathways, or other needs.

### Lift location

For folks who need to use the lifts to access registration on the 1st floor (or
conference on the 2nd floor).

This is the EuroPython entrance.
