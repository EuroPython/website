# Thank You

As we reflect on EuroPython 2024 in Prague, we are filled with immense gratitude for the year-long journey marked by innovation, teamwork, and dedication.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to making EuroPython 2024 a memorable experience both in Prague and online.

Since 2002, EuroPython has thrived on the passion and hard work of volunteers.
