# Thank You

As we reflect on EuroPython 2024 in Prague, we are filled with immense gratitude for the year-long journey marked by innovation, teamwork, and dedication. Our incredible team infused the event with their unique blend of enthusiasm, kindness, and creativity! We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to making EuroPython 2024 a memorable experience both in Prague and online.

Since 2002, EuroPython has thrived on the passion and hard work of volunteers. This year was no exception, with our devoted team investing countless hours and boundless energy into bringing EuroPython 2024 to life. Let us now celebrate the amazing individuals whose efforts made this event possible!
