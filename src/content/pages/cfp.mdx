EuroPython reflects the colourful and diverse backgrounds, cultures and
interests of our community, so you (yes, you!) should go for it: **propose
something and represent!**

No matter your level of Python or public speaking experience, EuroPython's job
is to help you bring yourself to our community so we all flourish and benefit
from each other's experience and contribution.

If you’re thinking, “but they don’t mean me”, then we especially mean **YOU**.

- If you’re from a background that isn't usually well-represented in most Python
  groups, get involved - we want to help you make a difference.

- If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most Python groups,
  get involved - we want your help making a difference.

- If you’re worried about not having enough technical knowledge, get involved -
  your fresh perspective will be invaluable.

- If you think you’re an imposter, join us - many of the EuroPython organisers
  feel this way.

- This is a volunteer led community, so join us - you will be welcomed with
  friendship, support and compassion.

You are welcome to share your questions and ideas with our programme team at
[programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).

## The Conference Format

The conference will feature around 16 tutorials/workshops and 120 talk sessions:

- **Tutorials/Workshops (July 8th and 9th)**: hands-on **180 min sessions** with
  40-100 people

- **Talks (July 10th, until 12th)** : **30 or 45 min** : presentations of
  specific and general interest to the European Python community (including a
  dedicated PyData track)

You are also welcome to submit **posters**, which will be printed in large
formats. It is a graphical way to showcase your research, project or technology.
Posters are exhibited at the conference, can be read at any time by
participants, and can be discussed face-to-face with their authors during the
poster sessions between July 10th and 12th.

All presentations will be assigned one of the following levels:

- **Beginner** - where the audience requires little or no previous knowledge to
  engage with the subject matter.

- **Intermediate** - some knowledge is assumed, although aspects of the talk may
  introduce new (more advanced) topics.

- **Advanced** - the audience is full of subject matter experts... go ahead and
  really geek out.

In previous years we’ve had many beginner and intermediate level talks. **We’d
love to encourage more advanced level contributions too.** Come geek out with us
at the conference!

## Topics

We welcome presentations on any topic that will be of specific or general
interest to members of the Python community. We are a broad and deep community,
so talks that may, at first, seem niche or unexpected actually make EuroPython
the cosmopolitan place that it is. **It's your conference!**

Browse through our
[past conferences](https://www.europython-society.org/europython/) and
[talk videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/EuroPythonConference) for more ideas and
to learn where there may be gaps that ought to be filled.

For ideas to contribute to the PyData track, take a look at PyData events:
[pydata.org](https://pydata.org/).

## Selection Process

To ensure our programme reflects our diverse community, submissions go through
three rounds of review and refinement before the final programme is announced:

- **[Community voting]** (from March 20th, until March 30th): a voting round
  open to all 2015-2024 EuroPython conference ticket holders and anyone who
  proposes a talk for the 2024 conference. This helps us judge both the
  uniqueness, niche-ness, popularity and interestingness of each proposal.

- **Panel feedback** (from March 20th, until March 30th): a diverse group of
  experienced reviewers refine and provide constructive feedback on submissions
  within their realm of expertise. This helps us to judge the balance, quality
  and diversity of our programme.

- **Programme team** - appointed by the EuroPython Society, these volunteers
  curate the final programme based upon the results of community voting and
  panel feedback. They also ensure we meet editorial criteria such as diversity,
  depth and breadth of topics and speakers.

## First-Time Speakers

As in previous years, there will be a **Speaker Mentorship Programme** for
anyone who needs help preparing their contribution. We focus on those for whom
it might be their first time contributing to our conference, especially those
from under-represented backgrounds. To this end, we will match mentees with
experienced and supportive mentors and run two workshops online: one close to
the CFP closing date, focusing on improving your submissions; the other close to
the conference date, focusing on helping you improve your talk.

Mentorship Programme sign-up is open too, and will remain open until the 27th of
February. More details can be found on our [Mentorship page](/mentorship).

## Speaker Support

We hope to meet as many speakers as possible in person. To make attendance more
attractive, **accepted speakers are eligible for a free Conference Ticket;
accepted workshop & tutorial organisers are eligible for a free Combined
Ticket**. Travel and accommodation expenses will not be reimbursed, but our
[Financial Aid programme](/finaid) is open for applications, and we encourage
speakers, especially those from under-represented backgrounds, to apply.

**Childcare**: We are excited to offer free childcare at the venue. During the
conference hours, there will be a dedicated area with childcare professionals
who will look after your children. Make sure to register your free speaker
ticket for yourself and select how many children will require childcare at
checkout.

## Open Source

EuroPython's aim is to share knowledge, skills and experience for the benefit of
all in our open source community. To this end, we encourage your contribution to
be released under an open source licence, and for the tools and code needed to
engage with your talk to be freely available under an open source license.
Sales-oriented proposals whose main aim is to sell a product are discouraged at
EuroPython.

## Non-profit
