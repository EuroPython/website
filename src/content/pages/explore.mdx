<div class="mb-15"> </div>

At EuroPython, many attendees come with their families and friends. When you're not attending the conference, why not explore Prague and its surrounding areas?

Here are some tips and recommendations from our volunteers. We hope they help you and your companions have a great time in Prague!

## Getting around

### Public transport

In Prague, the recommended way to get around is by public transport:

- More information on getting around by public transport can be found [here](/where#getting-around-in-prague).
- You can use your regular bank cards for public transport within Prague.
- Public transport is generally fast and reliable.
- After midnight, the metro stops running, but buses are available.
- The public transport system is mostly safe, with no areas considered off-limits.

### Do I need to rent a car?

Some people may consider renting a car, but:

- In Prague, it's generally unnecessary due to limited parking availability and high costs.
- Cars can be rented at the airport or other places in the city, similar to most other cities.
- If you want to visit other towns, trains are a convenient and economical option.

### Be prepared for the weather

If you want to explore the city, you should be prepared for the weather. Here are answers to some common questions:

- Temperatures are usually above 30°C, so remember to carry water.
- Public water fountains (and toilets) are rare, so remember to carry more water.
- Use sunscreen.
- It rarely rains, but when it does, it tends to be brief showers. Find shelter until it passes, usually within about half an hour.

**For hiking, canoeing, kayaking, and similar activities, [mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz/) is highly recommended.** It allows you to plan your adventures in advance, even from abroad. It also features **marked hiking routes in red, green, and blue**, as well as campsites and other robust trip planning tools.

## Where to eat & drink?

Prague is a foodie's city! There are many places for nice food, from traditional Czech cuisine to vegan-friendly options.

### Food recommendations

Some yays and nays from our local volunteers:

- 👎 Trdelnik is a tourist thing: nothing original or authentic
- 👎 Pražská šunka (Prague ham) on the street: tourist trap
- 👍 Try Nakládaný Hermelín (pickled camembert)
- 👍 Smažený sýr (fried cheese)
- 👍 Svíčková (meat with vegetable sauce and dumplings)
- 👍 Guláš (goulash)

#### For veggies/vegans

We know some of us are veggies/vegans. Rest assured that you will find plenty of places serving veggie/vegan food:

- [Shromaždiště](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y8Rihf6pvMNQkFnU9): Offers great traditional Czech food in vegan versions, and great beer.
- [Eateria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/52VnUHg1C8qWkSjC8): Known for vegan junk food - best burger
- [Pastva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7tux1PYfSKcAdv6F7): Open during the day, serving European and healthy food
- [Dhaba Beas](https://dhababeas.cz/en/): Offers cheap buffets, with Indian and European dishes, widely available across Prague.
- [Share Sweet & Espresso Bar](https://www.sharesweetbar.cz/en): Coffee shop with the best vegan cakes

According to HappyCow, there are 89 vegan and vegetarian places in Prague. So it should not be an issue to find something. Czech restaurants typically only offer fried cheese and French fries, occasionally including pickled camembert as vegetarian/vegan options, given Czech cuisine's heavy emphasis on meat.

Hungry during the night? Go to any kebab place and order a falafel wrap with veggies. You can also go to Burrito Loco - a Mexican food chain. They offer vegan mana burrito and burrito with grilled veggies.

### Where to drink?

In European countries, it is popular to socialise over drinks (though there's no pressure to consume alcohol). Here are some recommendations:

- For craft beer: Try [Sibeeria Tap Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PrRja7hbprfnYqKN8) (Sour ale, APA, IPA, ale), Pivotéka, BeerGeek, [Zlý časy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rCYojfxCJuXwZicAA), Matuška (APA, IPA, ale), or Zíchovec (Sour ale, APA, IPA, ale)
- Pilsner-type beer: Everywhere
  - For mild and non-bitter Pilsner-style beer, try Únětice (available in a few places). They also offer an 8-degree one with lower alcohol content.
  - For more bitter options, try Plzeň/Pilsner, Kozel or Radegast.
