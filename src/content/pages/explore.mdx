<Image src={venueImage} width="1200" alt="" />

<br></br>

At EuroPython, many attendees will come with their families. While not attending the conference, why not go and explore Prague and the surrounding area?

Here are some tips and things to do provided by our volunteers. We hope they help you and your companions have a great time in Prague:

## Traveling around

### Public transport

In Prague, the recommended way to get around is public transport:

- There‚Äôs some info [here](https://ep2024.europython.eu/where#getting-around-in-prague)
- You can use your normal card to travel around by train within Prague
- It is usually fast and reliable
- After midnight, the metro stops, but there are buses
- Mostly safe, with no no-go stations or anything similar

### Do I need to rent a car?

Some people may consider renting a car, but:

- In Prague, this is unnecessary. It‚Äôs hard to find parking, and it‚Äôs expensive
- You can rent a car at the airport or other places in the city (like you normally do in other cities)
- If you want to visit other towns, you can use trains as well (they‚Äôre mostly cheap)

### Be prepared for the weather

If you want to explore the city, you will be exposed to the weather. So here are some answers to frequent questions like: What‚Äôs the weather like? What should you carry with you?

- Usually 30¬∞C+, so carry water
- There are no water fountains or public toilets, so carry more water
- Use sunscreen
- It rarely rains, but when it does, it‚Äôs shower rain. It‚Äôs best to just hide somewhere until it stops (it usually stops after half an hour or so).

## What to do while in Prague?

There are plenty of things you can do in Prague. Depending on your preferences, you can find things that interest you and your group.

### For culture lovers

### For nature lovers

- Pet≈ô√≠n Hill: Eiffel Tower (in Prague), nice view of the city
- Vy≈°ehrad: nice fortress next to the venue. It also features a park where you can sit and chill
- Letn√°: viewpoint

## Where to eat?

Prague is a food city! There are many places to find nice food, from traditional Czech food to vegan-friendly options.

### General recommendations

Some yays and nays from our local volunteers:

- üëé Trdelnik is a tourist thing: nothing original or authentic
- üëé Pra≈æsk√° ≈°unka on the street: tourist trap
- üëç Try Nakl√°dan√Ω Hermel√≠n (pickled camembert)
- üëç Sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr (fried cheese)
- üëç Sv√≠ƒçkov√° (meat with vegetable sauce and dumplings)
- üëç Gul√°≈° (goulash)

### For veggies/vegans

We know some of us are veggies/vegans. Don't worry, you will find places that serve you veggie/vegan food:

- Shrom√°≈ædi≈°tƒõ: typical Czech food in vegan versions, great food, and great beer
- Eateria: vegan junk food, best burger
- Pastva: open during the day only, European and healthy food
- Dhaba Beas: cheap buffet, Indian and European food, it‚Äôs everywhere
- Share Sweet & Espresso Bar: coffee shop with the best vegan cakes

According to HappyCow, there are 89 vegan and vegetarian places to eat. So it should not be an issue to find something. Typical Czech restaurants mostly only offer fried cheese and French fries, sometimes pickled camembert. Czech cuisine is mostly meat-heavy. Hungry during the night? Go to any kebab place and you can order a falafel wrap with veggies. You can also go to Burrito Loco - it‚Äôs a Mexican food chain and they offer vegan mana burrito and burrito with grilled veggies.
