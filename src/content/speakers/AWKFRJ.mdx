🖥️ Hey, I'm Sviat — a serial maintainer of and contributor to open source software. 👨‍💻
🌄 By day, I'm a Principal Software Engineer at [Ansible] Core Team. 🌅
🌇 By night, I'm involved in maintaining CherryPy and doing CI/CD for aio-libs/aiohttp along with various related contributions mostly to Python projects and its ecosystem. I'm also a [PyPA] member, author of the blessed [`pypi-publish` GitHub Action] and one of the maintainers of the [Python Packaging User Guide]. 🌆

My ongoing interest is GitHub Apps, Actions, bots and related things using their shiny new APIs. I'm at the beginning of crafting [a][octomachinery] [framework][octomachinery on GitHub] for that currently.

I'm proficient with Python Packaging and setting up CI/CD in open source projects at scale.
