Late-stage PhD student at Imperial. I specialise in designing and solving mathematical models efficiently. Feel free to ask me about how high-performance computing and open source code are being used in meteorology (weather/climate) and magnetohydrodynamics (plasma/fusion)! Passionate about bridging the gap between abstract math and practical coding.
