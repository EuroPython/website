Yke is a Machine Learning Engineer at Xebia with a background in astronomy and artificial intelligence. In the industry, he learned that models and algorithms often do not get past the experimentation phase, leading him to specialise in MLOps to bridge the gap between experimentation and production. As a professional in this field, Yke has developed ML platforms and use cases across different cloud providers, and is passionate about sharing his knowledge through tutorials and trainings.
