I’m a Student Researcher at the University of Stuttgart (Computational Linguistics) and an ML Developer Advocate at Hugging Face focusing on extracting better insights from Text + Audio.

I’ve been a freelancer, tax analyst, consultant, tech speaker and advisor for five years. In the past three years, I’ve invested significant time volunteering for open source and science organisations like Hugging Face, EuroPython, PyCons across APAC, Google Cloud Delhi, and Facebook Developer Circles.

Delhi native, I now live in Germany!
