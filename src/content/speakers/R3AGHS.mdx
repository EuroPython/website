I'm Michal, an Engineering Lead at Kiwi.com, a leading global travel tech company headquartered in the Czech Republic. I am passionate about solving challenging business problems using the latest technology and leading engineering teams. The combination of my engineering and leadership skills enables me to do what I enjoy most—learning new technologies and sharing insights with fellow engineers. Additionally, I am involved in organizing 'KEtchUp,' which are regular community meetups for developers in Košice, Slovakia. As one of the organizers responsible for the content, I contribute to enhancing the knowledge-sharing in the engineering community.
