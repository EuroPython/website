Samet has been chairing the Python Standards Group at Optiver since 2021, with
the mission of standardizing Python codebases by making best practices known to
everyone in the company. He advocates for clean, simple, and well-tested code.
He has earned his living using Python for more than 10 years and began
participating in the open-source CPython project last year. He continues to
contribute with new pull requests occasionally and really enjoys the opportunity
to give back!
