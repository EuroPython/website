I'm a senior software engineer at Kiwi.com, a leading global travel tech company headquartered in the Czech Republic, and I work on the Search team.

I particularly enjoy delving into CPython and its internal workings. My preference for creating things from scratch, as opposed to relying on pre-made solutions, has helped me develop a profound grasp of the technical foundations of software development.

I'm thrilled to share my knowledge and enthusiasm for Python and low-level programming with the Python community.
