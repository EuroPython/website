I am a happy and proud woman to have become an engineer, so I love technical challenges.  One of my strengths is communication, so I have been a web development teacher for people seeking a career change. I also mentor anyone who needs help, and I actively participate in the community either as a speaker, organizing events or as an active member of Python Spain (president '22-'24), PyLadies and Django Girls.  I have several publications in media talking about the importance of learning to code and the need for diversity in the industry.  If I had to summarize my role in one sentence, it would be "Developer working on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) from a technical perspective and happy to be part of the community".
