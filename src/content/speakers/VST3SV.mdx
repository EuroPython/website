Roberto works in Par-Tec, designing resilient, cloud and enterprise architectures based on open source components.

He was part of the [Italian Government's Digital Team](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/mission), the task force created to develop "the Country's operating system". There he worked to create a national API Ecosystem based on internet standards.

He's a Red Hat Certified Engineer and MySQL/MongoDB certified DBA, but loves maintaining free software.

A life ago he took a Math degree, and he's really proud of it.
