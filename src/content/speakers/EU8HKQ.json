  "biography": "I started using Python when I was a data scientist, but quickly found that what I like the most is building software for others to use. Thatâ€™s why most of the stuff I've learned over the years is focused on optimizing software from the point of view of the user.\r\n\r\nI am a developer with a unique blend of expertise in finance, software engineering, and data. When I'm building software, my mind veers towards thorough testing and expressive code. That's why I love Python!\r\n\r\nWhen not in front of a keyboard, I'm often found reading voraciously, near a pizza shop, or traveling. I may sometimes come across as too serious, but if you come bearing funny memes, or cookies, I can't help but smile.",
