I am a long-time Python developer of over a decade and often focus on static analysis and distribution problems. Python is a diverse and quickly growing community and I love to contribute to it even as I try to keep up. I currently help ActiveState deliver secure, pre-build python projects to enterprise customers and individual developers.
