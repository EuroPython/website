Hello! I'm Steven.

I'm currently a software engineer at Oxford Nanopore doing cool DNA things ðŸ§¬ I've worked in and around Python for 10 years, including teaching it! I've been to a few EuroPython's now (but this is my first time speaking at a conference ðŸ«£)

I have a bizarre list of hobbies: Aerial silks, (flying) trapeze, ice skating, pottery, knitting/crochet, climbing, ...
