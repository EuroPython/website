I work mostly on the backend, but also embedded devices. My primary focus are IoT and other network-oriented applications. That's one of the reasons I am not allowed to touch the UI.

I think the industry is going in circles and we invent LISP every 10 years. I don't know why I code in Python, since real programmers code in C.

Currently working as a System Architect at Silvair.
