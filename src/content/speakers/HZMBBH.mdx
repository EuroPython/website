Florian Bruhin ("The Compiler") is a long-time contributor and maintainer of
both the pytest framework and various plugins. He discovered pytest in 2015 -
since then, he has given talks and conducted workshops about pytest at various
conferences and companies. His primary project, qutebrowser (a keyboard-focused
web browser), has grown from a hobby to a donation-funded part-time job.
