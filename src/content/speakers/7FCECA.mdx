I am a Software engineer from Pilsen, Czech Republic, with more than 20 years of experience.

I develop web and data applications in Python. However, my area of expertise also includes everything required for their complete delivery and maintenance: frontend, databases, system administration, cloud deployment, containers, networks, development workflows, project management, and many others.

I am a co-organizer of Pilsen Pyvo, a local meetup for Python enthusiasts and developers.
