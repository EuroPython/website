I started using Python when I was a data scientist, but quickly found that what
I like the most is building software for others to use. Thatâ€™s why most of the
stuff I've learned over the years is focused on optimizing software from the
point of view of the user.

I am a developer with a unique blend of expertise in finance, software
engineering, and data. When I'm building software, my mind veers towards
thorough testing and expressive code. That's why I love Python!

When not in front of a keyboard, I'm often found reading voraciously, near a
pizza shop, or traveling. I may sometimes come across as too serious, but if you
come bearing funny memes, or cookies, I can't help but smile.
