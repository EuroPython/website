Alexander is a software engineer working in cybersecurity at Palo Alto Networks. He first got into coding because he speaks Russian and wanted to automate reading endless Russian disinformation.

He cares a lot about digital rights, inclusion in technology, writing safe code and contributing to the open source community.

When he isn't coding, he likes to drink at least 5 coffees a day and play basketball.
