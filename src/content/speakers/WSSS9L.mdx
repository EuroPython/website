I am a Professor of Theoretical Physics and current Director of Research and International Programmes at the Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria. I have been teaching Computational Physics as well as organizing workshops on Python in Nigeria. I have attended and made presentations at PYCONs including PyCon US (2012 and 2019) and PyCoN Za (2019) and the videos are online. As the need to extend the capability of the QPython and currently Pyroid in the teaching/learning of various fields of science and engineering, I have been engaging collaborators usually eager beginners and students to explore these fields with me.
I am current leading a project on the teaching/learning of data science using Pyroid in order to introduce data science to all those who cannot have access to a computer lab or afford their own laptops. These are low income earners in low income economies and therefore our so called crazy project will help to achieve Python accessibility, inclusivity, diversity and education
