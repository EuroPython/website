I’m a digital architect who constructs scalable structures using the magic of the cloud and Python. I’m a certified cloud engineer and an enthusiastic advocate of the Python language and its environments. In addition to this, I am the leader of the PyLadies Munich chapter — a community where individuals gather to learn, share, and nurture their growth.
