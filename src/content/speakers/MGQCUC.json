  "biography": "I'm Vishrut, a 26-year-old Senior Software Engineer at India's biggest sustainable grocery delivery service. My Python journey kicked off back in college, but it really took flight when I dove into building software for real customers at a massive scale. Python's been my go-to tech stack for years, and I love to share my learnings of making systems resilient. \r\n\r\nBesides wrangling code, I head up the Learning and Development squad in our company. I love running monthly workshops and tutorials on programming stuff. You'll often catch me hitting up conferences, either speaking or soaking up knowledge as an eager attendee.",
