I studied Mathematics and Physics and did my PhD in Computer Science. I worked in Research and as a manager (CTO, CEO) of a series of start-up companies (Planet Internet, KPN Hotspots, KPN RFID). Currently I work for my own start-up company Real Thinks and for Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences as a professor Software Development.

My research interests are Machine Learning and Human Learning, and how we can use insights in these topics to improve education.
