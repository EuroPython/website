Hi, I'm Samuel. I'm a Python and Rust developer from London.

I'm best known for creating Pydantic - a Python data validation library that has now morphed into a startup. Recently we released our first product: Pydantic Logfire, a new kind of observability platform based on the same principle as Pydantic â€” that powerful tools can still be easy to use.
