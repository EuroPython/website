I am a researcher in urban morphology and geographic data science focusing on quantitative analysis and classification of cities, remote sensing, and bits of AI. While not doing the research, I write open source software, promote open science and help others with their data.

I am an author or a maintainer of a range of open scientific software, including GeoPandas, the open source Python package for geographic data handling, momepy, the urban morphology measuring toolkit for Python, Xvec, the tool for vector data cubes, and PySAL, the Python library for spatial analysis.
