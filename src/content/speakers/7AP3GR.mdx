Mike is a data scientist and semi-lapsed astronomer. He likes applying cool deep
learning techniques (in particular foundational, self-supervised, and
unsupervised learning methods) to problems in astrophysics, earth observation,
medical diagnosis and imagery, and anything in-between. He especially enjoys
applying these methods to "out-of-domain" problems where deep learning
"shouldnâ€™t work"!
