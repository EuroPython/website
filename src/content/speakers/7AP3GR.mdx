Mike is a data scientist and semi-lapsed astronomer. He likes applying cool deep learning techniques (in particular foundational, self-supervised, and unsupervised learning methods) to problems in astrophysics, earth observation, medical diagnosis and imagery, and anything in-between. He especially enjoys applying these methods to "out-of-domain" problems where deep learning "shouldnâ€™t work"!
