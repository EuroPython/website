I was born in Italy but I have been living in the Netherlands for 5 years. I work as a Tech Recruiter, and I consider myself an empathic person and a big fan of active listening and emotional intelligence. These aspects of myself led me to focus my career around helping others find a job that would suit them, make them happy, and satisfied in the long run. Work plays such a vital role in everyone's life, and I'm glad when I can close my laptop at the end of the day and think that I made a difference for someone's well-being. My motto is from a Taylor Swift's song: "Never be so kind you forget to be clever, never be so clever you forget to be kind".
