I started using Python for analysing geospatial data and fell in love with it. Since graduating with a Master of Applied Geology from the University of TÃ¼bingen, I worked in the Software Industry, in roles doing System Engineering, automation, DevOps and backend development using mostly Python.
Currently, I work as a software engineer for Spectro Cloud. 
In my free time, I maintain a few open-source Projects written in Python, the most notable one is Pipenv.
