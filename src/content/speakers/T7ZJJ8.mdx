I am a passionate Deep Learning specialist implementing cutting-edge research ideas in business projects, connecting best practices from research and engineering environments. My primary interest area is Natural Language Processing, but I've also worked in other ML-related domains. With a team from ReasonFIeld Lab I'm developing open-source all-in-one XAI library - FoXAI.
