I am working at Safran as a research engineer. My major responsibility in the company is analyzing data obtained from airplanes and helicopters using various statistical models and machine-learning algorithms.
Formerly, I worked at Samsung Electronics in South Korea for 3 years as a senior engineer. At Samsung, I have developed various computer networking related algorithms and software for smartphones and IoT devices to improve user experiences.
Before joining Samsung, I finished my Ph.D. at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in South Korea. The theme of my thesis was "Traffic Engineering in Data Center Networks using Software Defined Networking."
