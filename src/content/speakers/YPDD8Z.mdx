Hi There! I'm Adrian, a data engineer. At dlthub, I am one of the cofounders and original inventor of the first version of dlt.

I started my data career in 2012, in the Berlin startup scene, where I did 5y of employed work. I eventually moved to freelancing, because I liked to do more work and skip the drama.

In this time i built many data warehouses, data products and data teams and saw first hand the friction between data scientists and engineering, that came largely from a different toolset and abstractions needed. This made me try building various boilerplate loading code and identify the need with clarity.
