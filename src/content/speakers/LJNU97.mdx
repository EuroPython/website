üëãüèª I'm Ester, a London-based web developer passionate about clean code, workplace culture, promoting inclusivity, and GraphQL. I work at [Torchbox](https://torchbox.com), where we develop and maintain the open-source content management system [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org). My focus is on building accessible and user-friendly websites and contributing to Wagtail.

I'm involved in organising [PyCon Italia](https://pycon.it), where I contribute to the website and help plan the conference. I'm also a core developer of [Strawberry GraphQL](https://strawberry.rocks), which has given me the opportunity to explore my interest in GraphQL even further.

In my free time, I attend conferences and meet-ups to learn about new trends and connect with people who share similar interests. I enjoy exchanging ideas on various topics, such as clean code, new technologies, and creating a more inclusive workspace.
