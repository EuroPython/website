Andrew has recently finished a book, due out later this year, about what it feels like to learn how to code. His language of choice was Python and, as part of his research, he became (and continues to be) involved in several different aspects of the Python and wider FLOSS community.

Andrew often appears before live audiences and on radio and TV, and has written and presented a number of films and radio series, including the 60-minute BBC TV documentaries Being Neil Armstrong and To Kill a Mockingbird at 50, and the three-part BBC Radio 4 history of the lives of submariners, People of the Abyss. The last decade has seen his focus shift more squarely to the digital revolution and its social implications, with high profile magazine and comment pieces appearing in The Economistâ€™s 1843 magazine, The Financial Times and the US and UK editions of The Guardian. Smith also features in Stanford University's History of the Internet podcast series. Find out more about Andrew via his [website](https://www.andrewsmithauthor.com/).
