Hi, I'm Zach.

I've been working professionally as a software developer for the last few years
and have been having an enormous amount of fun while doing it! Whether its
working on larger systems, network or IoT based systems or simple utility
scripts, there's always something new one can learn.

Like many, I enjoy getting into the details of systems, really trying to
understand what makes them tick.

Looking forward to EuroPythin2024!
