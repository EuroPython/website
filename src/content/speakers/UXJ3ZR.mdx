Hi, I'm Zach.

I've been working professionally as a software developer for the last few years and have been having an enormous amount of fun while doing it! Whether its working on larger systems, network or IoT based systems or simple utility scripts, there's always something new one can learn.

Like many, I enjoy getting into the details of systems, really trying to understand what makes them tick.

Looking forward to EuroPythin2024!
