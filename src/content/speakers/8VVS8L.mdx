Hello! My name is Cristián and I currently work as Senior R&D Manager at The Qt Company. One of my responsibilities is the Qt for Python project (PySide/Shiboken), which is the official set of links for the Qt framework to Python.
In my day to day I work with C++, Python and CPython, which are the common topics of my talks.

During my free time I like to help in different Open Source communities, mainly related to Python, such as Python en Español https://hablemospython.dev, Python Chile https://pythonchile.cl, Python España https://es.python. org, and many more activities like PyPi moderation, PyCon* organizer (PyConUS, PyConES, PyConCL), and bot programming :D
