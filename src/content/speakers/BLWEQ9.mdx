Jakub is currently leads the data science platform team that enables the Flyr for Hospitality Science department to develop, operate and maintain data science products in a user friendly and sustainable way. He started tinkering with Python for computer simulations and data analysis during his computation physics PhD studies, when NumPy and Matplotlib were brand new projects and Pandas had not met Python yet. Since then, Python and its ecosystem have become Jakub's de facto work and hobby toolset for anything programming and data modelling related. After leading the theory group at the tokamak department of the Institute of Plasma Physics in Prague, Jakub was in different roles in the data science and engineering landscape. He also co-founded PyData Prague meetup, performs an occasional speaker or tutor at meetups or conferences and tutors scientific computing with Python at the Czech Technical University.
