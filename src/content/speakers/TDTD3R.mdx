Biomedical Engineer from Madrid and current PhD student in Biophysics and Bioengineering at the University of Barcelona. I am passionate about biology and programming, and I love to mix both and give talks about it. In my day-to-day life I use Python to make my scientific tasks easier. Since April, I am part of the Board of Directors of the Python Spain Association with the role of secretary :)
