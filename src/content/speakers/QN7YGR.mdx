Long-time pythonista, Django fan, co-maintainer and co-author of DRF-Schema-Adapter and other OSS libraries

I am from Belgium and have been involved in open-source at different levels for about 20 years.

One of the things I enjoy the most is sharing knowledge with others. And this is why I enjoy writing tutorials as well as giving talks and workshops.
