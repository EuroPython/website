I’m Paolo Melchiorre, a longtime Python backend developer who contributes to the Django project and gives talks at tech conferences.

I’ve been a GNU/Linux user for over 20 years and I use and promote Free Software.

I graduated in Software Engineering, and I’m an alumnus of the University of Bologna, Italy.

I’ve been working in the web for 15 years, and now I’m the CTO of 20tab, a pythonic software company, for which I work remotely.
