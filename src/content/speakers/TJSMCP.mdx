I began my career as a programmer specializing in embedded solutions in 1997, and grow to the role of Chief Technology Officer in 2023. Through many successful projects, I gained a robust understanding of various software development paradigms. After more than 10 years as a code mentor, I earned twice the title 'Super Mentor in Engineering'.
