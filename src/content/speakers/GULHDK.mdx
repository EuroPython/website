Working as a software developer writing booking software for ferry companies, Martin has discovered Python in 2014 and has fallen in love with the language quickly. He uses it to write APIs and interfaces with booking software (written in classic "Navision" C/SIDE) and to automate all kinds of on-premise software and hardware tasks.

He has helped at Europython every year since 2017 and is part of the EuroPython Operations Team. He also volunteers at other Python events like PyConDE, Humble Data and is one of the organisers of the German language Python Barcamp in RÃ¼gen.
