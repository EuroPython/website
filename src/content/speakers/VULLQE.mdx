Brayan Kai is a Data Scientist Passionate about Communities, Technical Writing and Open-Source Advocacy.
He currently volunteers at different developer communities across Africa including Google Crowdsource, Open-Source Community Africa, She Code Africa, PyLadies Ghana and Dev Careers. All this owing to his strong passion for supporting fellow upcoming technologists, women in tech and advocating for inclusion and diversity. He calls this his personal mission.
It makes him happier, more balanced, and gives him a stronger sense of purpose to innovate, share, and teach in and with the community rather than just for it.
