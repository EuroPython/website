Brayan Kai is a Data Scientist Passionate about Communities, Technical Writing
and Open-Source Advocacy. He currently volunteers at different developer
communities across Africa including Google Crowdsource, Open-Source Community
Africa, She Code Africa, PyLadies Ghana and Dev Careers. All this owing to his
strong passion for supporting fellow upcoming technologists, women in tech and
advocating for inclusion and diversity. He calls this his personal mission. It
makes him happier, more balanced, and gives him a stronger sense of purpose to
innovate, share, and teach in and with the community rather than just for it.
