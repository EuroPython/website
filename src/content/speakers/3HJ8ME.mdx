I'm currently trying to finish a PhD. in High-Performance Computing at the IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Centre. I also teach various programming subjects at the VSB-TUO university in Ostrava and I'm a passionate open-source contributor, primarily to the Rust compiler and its ecosystem, where I'm a member of several Rust development teams.
