Pythonista and a YAML Engineer with 7 years of experience in building and maintaining Observability systems using Open-Source software and tools. 

Toomas started his journey working as a technician in Data Centers, making his way to working as an Application Administrator and Sysadmin building & maintaining Metrics and Logging systems (Zabbix & Elasticsearch). During that time, he started writing monitoring scripts in Python, ending up in inheriting a NOC software that was written in Python - giving him an opportunity to learn more about software development in Python. 

In 2018, Toomas ended up leaving his home country of Estonia for someone he met in Tinder to "give love a chance"...

As he moved to the UK, he worked in some devopsy roles in London and Oxford. In the end, when things didn't work out - he ended up moving to London - working for what he'd like to think of as an Estonian company.  

In London, he also met his current partner (in real life), who he's been together with for 3 years now.

During his time in Wise he's been able to work on systems at scale, progress through engineering levels (IC2 - IC5) - pursuing an Individual Contributor track and focus on solving interesting engineering problems.

As their LinkedIn says - their job is to break stuff and build things...
