I've gained my degree in Theoretical Computer Science on Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. Currently I work as a Senior Python Developer at CZ.NIC, taking care of .cz domain registry and its ecosystem. I've been programming for almost 20 years, 7 of those as a professional Python developer. I'm a Linux and FOSS enthusiast and I like to submit PRs to open source projects whenever possible. In my free time, I do enjoy practicing partner acrobatics.
