I've gained my degree in Theoretical Computer Science on Charles University in
Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. Currently I work as a Senior Python
Developer at CZ.NIC, taking care of .cz domain registry and its ecosystem. I've
been programming for almost 20 years, 7 of those as a proffesional Python
developer. I'm a Linux and FOSS enthusiast and I like to submit PRs to open
source projects whenever possible. In my free time, I do enjoy practicing
partner acrobatics.
