I am a final year Ph.D. student with expertise in Galaxy Evolution and Deep Learning at the Institute for Astrophysics of the Canaries (IAC, Spain). My work combines integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data and cosmological simulations with Deep Learning techniques to study how the physically resolved properties of nearby galaxies (z<0.15) relate to their assembly history. Looking for jobs!
