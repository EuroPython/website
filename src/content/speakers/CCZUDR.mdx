I am on a quest to solve problems with data using ML and AI. Over the years I have built multiple industry first solutions for diverse domains like Marketing, Supply Chain, Polymers and Chemicals etc. I have consulted numerous multi-national companies, helping them build in house capabilities ( via corporate training ), providing Project based support and developing SoA solutions for their customers. I love sharing my experiences and giving back to the community I have learned so much from. This would by my 3rd talk at EuroPython!
