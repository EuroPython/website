I'm Anna-Lena, a machine learning engineer living in Bonn, Germany. I'm very passionate about learning and love to share my knowledge with other people. Besides machine learning I love teaching Python and have been a regular guest on PyCon events and podcasts. You can find my projects either on GitHub (https://github.com/zotroneneis) or on my personal webpage (https://alpopkes.com/).
