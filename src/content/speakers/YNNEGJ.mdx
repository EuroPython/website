I am a Director of Engineering at Canonical, where I lead documentation practice. I enjoy helping organise community conferences for Python and Django, and helping people and open-source projects improve their documentation.

I am the author of the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr), and unless I commit a noteworthy crime I expect that is what I will be best known for.
