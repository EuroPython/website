My name is Akinbo Racheal, an author, writer, and researcher. I Possess a Master's Degree in Computer Science and currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Federal University of Technology Akure Ondo State Nigeria.
My professional goals lie in my ability to become a stand-out female Professor in Computer Science, lecturer, solution developer and research scientist applying problem-solving technologies to make a difference in the lives of students, institutions, communities and my nation at large.
I am a high flyer and achiever with strong presentation skills and a responsible person. I also have excellent oral and communication skills with independent and creative working skills.
