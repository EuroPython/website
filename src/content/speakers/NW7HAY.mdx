Petr works at Red Hat, integrating Python into Linux distros.

He started contributing to Python in 2015, answering Nick Coghlan's call for a volunteer to improve extension module loading. After about six PEPs and eight years of work, that project expanded to better support for subinterpreters and maintaining the stable ABI, and helping Eric Snow's effort to break up the GIL.

Last year, after a nomination for Steering Council forced him to look at parts of the project that needed help, Petr revived the Documentation community, and spent time removing roadblocks from contributing to Python's documentation.

To give back to the community, he started teaching free courses to local beginners. But that is a story for his talk at EuroPython.
