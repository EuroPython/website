Full-time PhD student in Bioinformatics doing research, teaching and being taught. I'm currently exploring the world of proteins, their 3D structure and function with a focus on proteins with a knot in their structure and I combine it with state-of-the-art Machine learning approaches. In the meantime, I also enjoy teaching a Machine learning course for the first time. Before I started my PhD, I was helping with some classical bioinformatics tasks in the Bioinformatics core facility and also doing some Machine learning on genomic data.
