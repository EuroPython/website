Born and raised in Graz, Austria, i grew up playing videogames from the age of 6 years. A C64  somewhere around 1998 was the first computer i could sink my teeth in - First BASIC programs were programmed and the coding bug had stung me! Combined with my love for videogames i could only see one profession which would satisfy me: Making videogames!

After studying graphics and playing around with early versions of 3D Studio Max, i was hired by Neo Software, one of the most famous videogame developer of Austria in 2000. My dream became true!

In 2003 i finally stumbled over Python, as it slowly but sure wiggled itself into tool development for game production. It was love on first sight. This helped me greatly to improve all sides of the art and development process within the daily videogame business!

Now, in 2024,  i can look back on a career of over 20 years of professional game development!
