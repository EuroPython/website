Hello! I'm Ramon, a data scientist, researcher, and educator living in Sydney. I currently work as a freelance data professional and was previously a Senior Product Developer at Decoded, a technology education company based in the UK. While at Decoded, I created custom data science tools, workshops, and training programs for clients in industries ranging from retail to finance. Prior to that, I held roles at the intersection of education, data science, and research in the areas of entrepreneurship and strategy, alongside a few ventures in consumer behavior and development economics research in industry and academia, respectively. On the personal side, I enjoy giving talks and technical workshops and have had the privilege of participating in several conferences such PyCon, SciPy, PyData, and countless meetup events. In my spare time, I spend as much time as possible mountain biking and exploring many of the outdoor wonders Australia has to offer.
