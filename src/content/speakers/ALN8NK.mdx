Iâ€™m a Python developer since 2017, I am deeply passionate about my craft and love sharing my knowledge with others. I find joy in constantly learning new things and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry. In fact, I'm so passionate about sharing knowledge that I spend my free time mentoring aspiring developers in Python workshops in my hometown. I'm also an organizer of local IT meetups, where I get to connect with like-minded professionals and discuss the latest trends and challenges in our field.
