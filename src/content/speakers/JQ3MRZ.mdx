I'm a Python Developer Advocate and Software Engineer at Vonage (ex-IBM). I'm interested in communications APIs, machine learning, open-source, developer experience and dancing! My training is in Physics, and now I use my problem-solving skills daily, working on open-source projects and finding ways to make developersâ€™ lives better.
