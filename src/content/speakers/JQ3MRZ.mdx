I'm a Python Developer Advocate and Software Engineer at Vonage (ex-IBM). I'm
interested in communications APIs, machine learning, open-source, developer
experience and dancing! My training is in Physics, and now I use my
problem-solving skills daily, working on open-source projects and finding ways
to make developersâ€™ lives better.
