Naomi Ceder earned a Ph.D in Classics several decades ago, but switched from ancient human languages to computer languages sometime in the last century. Since 2001, she has been learning, teaching, writing about, and using Python.

An elected fellow of the Python Software Foundation, Naomi is a past chair of its board of directors, and in 2022 became the seventh person selected to receive the PSF Distinguished Service Award. A founder of Trans*Code, a hackday centered on the trans and non-binary community, she also speaks internationally about the Python community and inclusion and diversity in technology in general.
In her spare time Naomi enjoys playing classical guitar.
