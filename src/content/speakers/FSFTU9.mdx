BÃ¡ra has been part of the Czech Python community since 2015 when she helped organise the first PyCon CZ. Since then, she took part in about 80 Pyvo meetups in Prague, enjoying the lively community and making new friends. The thing she loves most about community events is the feeling of togetherness, of making things happen for big groups of people... and a cold beer at the afterparty.
