I'm a Python developer with a high experience in web frameworks, database ORMs and creating various APIs. Through my career I worked in various interesting industries, including some work for travel agencies, online gambling sites, creating point of sales and cash registers as well as "in person" payment processing. Enjoying various Python conferences across Europe since 2015 and EuroPython since 2022. Outside working hours I'm also interested in security engineering and I'm a (slightly retired) member of a CTF team.
