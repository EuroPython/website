Hi, I'm Arthur, a software engineer based in Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ¥–

I worked as an engineer in a few tech companies over the past years, mostly building software with Python but I'm also passionate about (too ??) many other software fields.

I'm an Open source enthusiast and love to contribute when I have the possibility. 2 years ago, I built ODMantic, an ODM for MongoDB & Python. It's a kind of ORM but built on top of Pydantic in order to provide a seamless model definition and integration with FastAPI.

Last year, I founded CodSpeed, a Continuous Performance Analysis solution helping tech companies to prevent performance issues directly in their CI pipelines.
