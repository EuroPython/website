  "biography": "Hi, I help AI/ML companies and their AI/data scientists turn ML models from the data lab into PoCs, MVPs, or fully functional products that convincingly prove their value to investors and other important decision-makers.\r\n\r\nBy using #Python and #AWS as superpowers, I help you get real business value from your ML algorithms.\r\n\r\nAnd I happily consult your AI scientists on how to write clean, reusable code in Python and thus save thousands (or even millions) on ML-based software deployment and development.",
