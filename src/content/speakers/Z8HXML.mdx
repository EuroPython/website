Over the past five years living in Germany, I've immersed myself in the tech industry, acquiring a broad spectrum of experiences. My skill set is diverse, covering the development of web applications using Python and the creation of robust AWS cloud solutions. I possess a solid grasp of design patterns and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside a proficiency in event-driven and microservices architectures. My experience extends to designing REST APIs and working with various database technologies. Committed to continuous learning, I consistently improve my skills to employ tools and technologies following industry best practices.
