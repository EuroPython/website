After being a programmer for a good few years, I changed career in 2022 to become a Developer Educator at Aiven (https://aiven.io/tibs). My favourite programming language is Python, my favourite markup language is reStructuredText, my favourite storage technologies are SQLite, PostgreSQL and Redis, and I'm rather enthusiastic about Apache Kafka as a messaging system.
