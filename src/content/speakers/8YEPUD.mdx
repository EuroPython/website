After being a programmer for a good few years, I changed career in 2022 to become a Developer Educator at Aiven (https://aiven.io). My favourite programming language is Python, my favourite markup language is reStructuredText, my favourite storage technologies are SQLite, PostgreSQL and Redis, and since joining AIven I've become all enthusiastic about Apache Kafka.
