In 2012, I made the exciting transition from management and strategy to software development, and I haven't looked back since. Python has been my trusty companion on this journey as I've crafted scalable systems that push technical boundaries. Currently, I have the privilege of leading a core/global team in Kraken Technologies and working with very talented software developers on a daily basis.
