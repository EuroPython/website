I am a member of the GraalVM team at Oracle Labs. I was led here by my interests in programming languages and virtual machine design, and my involvement with the PyPy/RPython project and various other dynamic language VMs. My work revolves around dynamic language interoperability, connecting them with native C code in a safe manner, and providing cross-language tool support. I also continue to collaborate with the HPI at the University of Potsdam on tools and environments for dynamic languages and polyglot programming.
