I am a software engineer with experience of working with IT companies in Silicon Valley, USA (Salesforce, Slack, PayPal). After spending about eight years contributing and leading various projects in the USA, I have recently relocated back to India. Currently, I am taking a career break to adjust to the relocation and recharge myself before embarking on my next professional adventure.

My day job involved dealing with imposter syndrome among an army of coding geniuses at Slack and perform as a Staff Engineer on the side. I've expertise in architecting and delivering large-scale systems in public and private clouds, leveraging technologies like Python, Java, GoLang, Chef, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Apache Mesos, and Aurora. I love open source software and contribute to it whenever I get a chance.
