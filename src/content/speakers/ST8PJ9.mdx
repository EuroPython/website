I am a passionate biologist, working as a Sr. Data Scientist in Berlin. In my spare time, I love to develop projects that can help people around, especially people who are eager to learn new things in tech. For that reason, I try to develop projects that are beginner-friendly, even with complex topics. 
I am an active member in the Python Berlin communities, helping to organize workshops and participating actively in mentoring newcomers (specially, people who are changing from career path) and giving talks in many local communities like PyLadies and also in international conferences. Moreover, I participated in the python documentation translation (English-Spanish) and I am  coordinator in the discord channel of  "Python en Espa√±ol".
