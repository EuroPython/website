Jessica Tegner is an open-source software developer and computer science student from Denmark who has been a part of the open source world for over 13 years. She is a maintainer of pypandoc, a thin wrapper for the universal document converter pandoc. Being fully blind has not stopped her from working as a software engineer intern at Uber, being a member of the first GitHub Accelerator program or having the opportunity of being a world-conference public speaker.
