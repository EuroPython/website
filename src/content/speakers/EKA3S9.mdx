Eli is a developer, problem-finder and professional nerd who has been in tech since being released back into the wild from university. They’re currently working as a developer advocate at Scaleway, a European cloud provider, where they get to learn all sorts of weird things about how the internet works and then tell other people about them. In the past, they’ve worked in biotech, analog circuit design, and telecoms. They also speak regularly at conferences all over the world, including at NDC, PyCon UK and WeAreDevelopers World Congress.

Outside of work, they like to knit, hang out with their cat, and try to stop their cat from eating their knitting.
