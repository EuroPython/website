Hi! I am Shagun, a research engineer with Meta AI. I primarily work in reinforcement learning and lifelong learning. Previously, I was a machine learning engineer with Adobe Research. My stack is Python-based and I love playing with new technology. I am looking forward to meeting people at EuroPython :).
