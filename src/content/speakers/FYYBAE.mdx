It all started with a PyLadies Python course in 2017 and I've been active in the Czech Python community ever since. After the beginner's course I got hooked into programming, learned the basics of Linux, and got impressed with the open-source project development. With that I could kickstart my career in IT: first as QA, now as a software engineer working with open-source software. Outside the world of IT, I like watching herbs grow, going on long hikes, dreaming of a better world and, on unrelated manner, reading fiction.
