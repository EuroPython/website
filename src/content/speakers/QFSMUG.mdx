Hey,
I'm Johannes, a Data Scientist at celebrate company by day and an AI storyteller by night.

After experiences in research at Fraunhofer Fokus Institute and tinkering with sensor setups for autonomous vehicles, I decided to get more hands-on and joined celebrate company, where I'm now bringing models from the NLP, CV and the Multimodal research world into production.

Since last year I occasionally lead a Computer Vision Study Group on the Hugging Face discord server, where I present papers embedded in presentations with a little geeky twist. You can find an overview of the past study groups (not all lead by me) right here: [HF CV Study Group](https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/computer-vision-study-group).
