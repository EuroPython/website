Senior Backend Developer/Architect with current focus on Python, but "polylanguage".

Worked in Science, Insurance, AI and a couple of other areas. In the past I taught people about DDD and TDD, as well as pragmatic adoption of design patterns from SOLID, Clean Code and more.

Companies I worked for include Max Planck Institutes, Check24, Deutsche Bahn and now MARA Solutions. Before I became a software developer, I worked in various jobs including at a home for the severely disabled, in a call center, and on an assembly line.

When I'm not coding, I watch my kids grow rapidly fast or read Sci-Fi and play RPGs (analogue in form of pen'n'paper as well as digital).
