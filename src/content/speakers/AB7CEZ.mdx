Backend Developer with current focus on Python. Worked in Science, Insurance, AI and a couple of other areas. In the past I taught people about DDD and TDD, as well as pragmatic adoption of design patterns from SOLID/Clean Code and more.
When I'm not coding, I watch my kids grow rapidly fast or read Sci-Fi and play RPGs (analogue in form of pen'n'paper as well as digital).
