Hi,

I am Jothir Adithyan a 22 year old self taught Python developer from Kerala.

I have been enthusiastic about computers and networking ever since I first got my hand on computer and discovered the internal working of it. I have been an active member of the Kerala and Indian python community often attending talks and contributing to them, also writing code in my leisure time.

I am currently a product engineer at Strollby. I work in company with a tight knit group of brilliant engineers helping them solve a variety of hurdles in implementing a ginormous codebase.
