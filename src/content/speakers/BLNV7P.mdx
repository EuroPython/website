Rodrigo has always been fascinated by problem solving and that is why he picked
up programming â€“ so that he could solve more problems. He also loves sharing
knowledge, and that is why he spends so much time writing articles in his blog
[mathspp.com/blog](https://mathspp.com/blog), writing on Twitter
[@mathsppblog](https://twitter.com/mathsppblog), and giving workshops and
courses. You can also find his past talks on
[https://mathspp.com/talks](https://mathspp.com/talks).

His main areas of scientific interest are mathematics (numerical analysis in
particular) and programming in general (with a preference for the Python and APL
languages), but Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy
movies and eating chocolate.
