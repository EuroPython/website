Rodrigo has always been fascinated by problem solving and that is why he picked up programming â€“ so that he could solve more problems. He also loves sharing knowledge, and that is why he spends so much time writing articles in his blog [mathspp.com/blog](http://mathspp.com/blog), writing on Twitter [@mathsppblog](https://twitter.com/mathsppblog), and giving workshops and courses.

His main areas of scientific interest are mathematics (numerical analysis in particular) and programming in general (with a preference for the Python and APL languages), but Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy movies and eating chocolate.

All materials can be accessed from [this GH repo](https://github.com/mathspp/talks).
