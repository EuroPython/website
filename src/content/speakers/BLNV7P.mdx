Rodrigo has always been fascinated by problem solving and that is why he picked up programming â€“ so that he could solve more problems. He also loves sharing knowledge, and that is why he spends so much time writing articles in his blog [mathspp.com/blog](https://mathspp.com/blog), writing on Twitter [@mathsppblog](https://twitter.com/mathsppblog), and giving workshops and courses. You can also find his past talks on [https://mathspp.com/talks](https://mathspp.com/talks).

His main areas of scientific interest are mathematics (numerical analysis in particular) and programming in general (with a preference for the Python and APL languages), but Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy movies and eating chocolate.
