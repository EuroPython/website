At Salted CX, my role as a Machine Learning engineer revolves around specializing in Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I utilize Transformer models to gain insights into the operations of contact centers, enhancing visibility and understanding. I hold an Engineering Doctoral (EngD) degree in Data Science from the Technical University of Eindhoven.
