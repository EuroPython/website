At Salted CX, my role as a Machine Learning engineer revolves around
specializing in Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I utilize Transformer
models to gain insights into the operations of contact centers, enhancing
visibility and understanding. I hold an Engineering Doctoral (EngD) degree in
Data Science from the Technical University of Eindhoven.
