Ines Montani is a developer specialising in tools for AI and natural language processing (NLP) technology.

Sheâ€™s the co-founder and CEO of [Explosion](https://explosion.ai/), a core developer of [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), a popular open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python, and [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), a modern annotation tool for creating training data for machine learning models.

Ines, who had already [keynoted EuroPython](https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/events/keynotes/index.html) five years ago, will share with us the developments, progress and lessons learned in the field of natural language processing. It'll be an opportunity for us to collectively retrospect on half a decade of work in the Python community within a field that is gaining in popularity and momentum.
