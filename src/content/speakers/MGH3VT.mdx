I am Python software developer since 2010. Mostly web applications. 
I have made right choices, wrong choices and had to maintain someone elseâ€™s choices. I have built simple and complex web applications from scratch, took over complex systems, endured countless upgrades and dependency changes. 

I started as a fullstack developer and system administrator. 
I have been a team lead, a mentor and a software architect. 

However, I was always, first and foremost, a developer.
