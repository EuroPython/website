I've now been coding more years than not, and have been working with Django
professionally for 10 years. Particular areas of interest to me are Django's
ways of interacting with the database, testing using pytest, and data processing
pipelines. I've written a couple minor public libraries, am maintain a couple
more, and have written a lot of tooling internally for the SaaS application my
company is developing.

Born and raised in Prague, Czech Republic, now I live in London after studying
software engineering at FIT CTU and data science at UCL in London.
