I've now been coding more years than not, and have been working with Django professionally for 10 years. Particular areas of interest to me are Django's ways of interacting with the database, testing using pytest, and data processing pipelines. I've written a couple minor public libraries, am maintain a couple more, and have written a lot of tooling internally for the SaaS application my company is developing.

Born and raised in Prague, Czech Republic, now I live in London after studying software engineering at FIT CTU and data science at UCL in London.
