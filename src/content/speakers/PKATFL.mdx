As a software engineer and a lifelong tinkerer/maker, I have a deep-rooted passion for building, fixing, and breaking things. I recently earned a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and have gained experience working at both small startups and large companies. I thrive on fixing hard bugs and diving deep into challenging problems.

Beyond my professional work, I'm also involved in an exciting Cubesat project at Portland State University. When I'm not immersed in technology, I enjoy outdoor activities such as biking, rock-climbing, and spending quality time with my dog, Bruce.
