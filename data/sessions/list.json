    "description": "Most practical machine learning these days is \"supervised learning\". In supervised learning, we show a model a collection of example inputs and outputs, and train it to give the right output for each input. For example, we might show it pictures of animals, combined with a \"label\" for each picture like \"cat\" or \"dog\", in order to train it to identify which animal is in each photo. Or we could show it samples of text from Twitter posts, and give the tweets \"labels\" like \"toxic\" or \"not toxic\", in order to train it to identify unwanted tweets and filter them out automatically. In effect, the model learns to predict the correct \"label\" for any input that it sees.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule in supervised learning is that the more data you have, the better the model you can train. More data means more accuracy, whether the task is recognizing animals in images, or classifying text, or even driving a self-driving car. This is a real problem, though, when data collection isn't free; without a huge dataset of inputs and labels, it might be hard or impossible to train a model that's accurate enough for what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nProbably the single biggest revolution in machine learning in the last 5 years, particularly in NLP (natural language processing), has been the arrival of \"foundation models\", huge models trained for very long periods on vast amounts of text data. These models offer a solution to the problem of limited training data - by bringing a huge amount of linguistic prior knowledge with them, they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to learn a new task. In 2016, training a model to classify toxic comments might have required millions (or even tens of millions!) of examples and labels in order to achieve acceptable accuracy, but in 2022, we can start with a foundation model that already \"knows\" a lot about language, and achieve the same accuracy with a tiny fraction of that, and in a much shorter time, too!\r\n\r\nFoundation models can be intimidating, though - they're often created by industrial or academic research labs and published in papers that can be very impenetrable for people without a strong research background. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to abstract away that complexity and load, train and use foundation models without needing a Ph.D, or even any prior experience in machine learning! By the end of this 3-hour session, you should have the knowledge and code samples you need to train a better machine learning model than someone at the cutting edge of the field in 2016 could have achieved even with an entire research team.\r\n\r\nIn this course, we will use HuggingFace Transformers combined with the TensorFlow machine learning library. We will also use some of the most popular data science libraries in Python like Numpy and Pandas when preparing our data. You don't have to be familiar with any of these before attending the tutorial, and I'll do my best to explain what we're doing with them as we go! I don't assume any specific background in machine learning, and we won't need any mathematics beyond high school level. I will, however, assume that you're reasonably fluent in Python!",

    "description": "Attacks on software repositories are extremely common and can have a vast impact. A single successful compromise of the content distribution infrastructure can affect millions of users, voluntarily installing the infected packages.\r\n\r\n[PEP 458](https://peps.python.org/pep-0458/) was designed to protect PyPI against a variety of possible attacks on PyPIs own content distribution network and PyPI mirrors, while giving administrators a mechanism to recover from a compromise if it happens. In addition, PEP 458 is a fundamental stepping stone for more advanced protection described in [PEP 480](https://peps.python.org/pep-0480/).\r\n\r\nBoth PEP 458 and 480 implement a specification called [\"The Update Framework\" (TUF)](http://theupdateframework.io/), which introduces a series of roles, keys and metadata formats that are published along with the packages they protect, and can be verified by a client software such as pip.\r\n\r\nOver the past couple of months we have made an effort to integrate the latest version of the Python TUF reference implementation with PyPI/Warehouse (see [draft PR](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/10870)).\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will give an introduction to PEP 458 and TUF, how it works and what it is good for. We will report from the work-in-progress integration with Warehouse, what challenges we face and how Python developer and user workflows are affected, as well as an expected timeline for the integration. And last but not least, we want to give an outlook of what comes after PEP 458, that is full developer-to-user end-to-end protection of Python packages as described by PEP 480.\r\n\r\nWith our talk we also hope to spark interest in software supply chain security and to encourage the community to get involved by reviewing, commenting and contributing to the PEP 458 and PEP 480 integration efforts.",

It has been dubbed the ‚Äò4th‚Äô R‚Äô (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic. So, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten to all the way to high school. And now young people are successfully mastering this skill.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe a case study whereby Computer Programming (Python) was introduced for the first time to a group of young people and how the young people are using it to explore and understand real world problems and data such as those relating to climate change, world population growth and carbon dioxide emissions with Python visualisation libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas. We will talk about the joys and challenges and discoveries made by the young people. We will conclude with suggestions on how to proceed in this area.",

We will cover a better way: an automated process in which new versions are automatically published by merging pull requests.",
    "description": "Empowering anyone to issue a new release by submitting a pull request? At first glance, it seems like an outlandish idea. Upon further inspection, however, the benefits become clear.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest sources of friction in software development is packaging and publishing new releases. Somebody has to sift through the commits and write a change-log, tag it with a new version number, and publish the package to PyPI. And usually only one or two people have the access necessary for this last step.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate result is an infrequent release cadence. Bug fixes and new features are sitting there in the `main` branch, but hardly anybody is benefiting from them because they aren‚Äôt in a shipped release yet.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there‚Äôs a better way: a continuous release process where new versions are auto-published via pull requests ‚Äî without any manual monkeying.\r\n\r\nIn this environment, all pull requests must include a release file that describes the changes within. This file must also include whether the new version should be a major, minor, or patch release.\r\n\r\nThe continuous integration (CI) process looks for this file, and if one hasn‚Äôt been included, the tests will fail, and the pull request won‚Äôt be merged. Otherwise, a maintainer merges the pull request, and the CI process then uses the release file to put the description into the change-log, increment the version number, commit, tag, build, and publish the new release to PyPI.\r\n\r\nSo with almost no human input, every code contribution results in a new release in a matter of minutes. Every feature and bug-fix has its own release, without anyone having to remember to package and publish a new version. Plus, if a bug is found, it‚Äôs now much easier to trace it to a specific release version.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best part is that all contributors get to issue their own releases. What better way to welcome new contributors than to reward them with a dedicated release composed entirely of their own work?\r\n\r\nAttendees of this talk will take home the following knowledge and skills:\r\n\r\n* what kinds of problems are introduced by an infrequent release cadence\r\n* how automated releases solve those problems and provide myriad ancillary benefits\r\n* how to format and parse the release file\r\n* how to use continuous integration (CI) systems to automate releases\r\n* how to add deployment code so new versions are released when PRs are merged\r\n* how to use [AutoPub](https://github.com/autopub/autopub) to facilitate this process",

The need then arises to make Python-based computational methods accessible ‚Äì we present case-studies of how to do this via various Python modules being taught at College of Business in Technological University Dublin and by means of walkthrough of an interdisciplinary social good project called InEire. It comes down to complementing existing quantitative and qualitative methods with methods based on analysis of various types of data specific to the social science problem being solved. We essentially go through the process of building curiosity-driven exploration in social science students via a theoretically driven research question rather than the Python technique itself, and then focusing on the various steps involved in solving that question; and finally boiling it down to a concrete Python-based data analytics methodology. This project-based teaching methodology helped us develop Python skills in newbies eventually leading to a Python-based data analytic skills in students of disciplines other than Computer Science.",
    "description": "The various areas within humanities and social sciences such as political science, sociology, psychology, economics etc. have evolved to a point where they have been complementing existing qualitative and quantitative methods with methods rooted in data science. This shift in paradigm is primarily driven by real-world, publicly available data sets that cover a variety of scholarly domains and have the potential to solve fundamental research questions in these intriguing fields. There is however a huge bottleneck to be overcome before realizing the full potential of data science in arts, humanities and social sciences; and that bottleneck relates to a fear of programming in students/researchers within these disciplines. Our talk presents some tips and tricks from course modules being taught in Technological University Dublin; the fundamental idea is to present an overview of data science toolkit and how it relates to problem solving in the real world. \r\n\r\nFirst we will present ways to make the data science lifecycle being made easy via tools such as Google colab and Jupyter notebooks followed by explaining how showing students the big picture and the workflow lifecycle of a data science technique helps grasps concepts in a very effective manner. We will present examples from exploratory data analysis and classification using data-driven research questions; and look into elegant solutions that can easily be plugged into a social scientist‚Äôs skillset. Examples of continuous assessment projects based on different Python libraries are also presented with a view to further establish use of Python as a valuable tool for arts, humanities, and social sciences.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will give an overview of an Irish research council funded project emanating from a combination of STEM and HUMANIITIES disciplines that aims to perform an economic assessment of anti-immigrant sentiment in Ireland. Various phases of the project will be explained emphasizing particularly those where Python tools play a major role in interpretion of research outcomes. These research outcomes obtained through smart use of Python data analytic tools play a key role in building relationships between data scientists and policy makers in both government and not-for-profit sector.",

    "description": "Applications of Python in Computational Chemistry and Material Design\r\nOwain T. Beynon, Alun Owens, Andrew J. Logsdail\r\nCardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales.\r\n\r\nComputational methods afford an insight into the behaviours and properties of materials and recently Python packages have increasingly become a powerful tool for the study of chemical systems. Computational chemistry is the branch of chemistry that studies chemical systems through simulation and involves HPC architecture and software packages. In general, there are two categories of simulation, dynamic and static and of these types, atoms in the system may be described by varying levels of theory: molecular (classical) mechanics (MM), quantum mechanics (QM) or a combination of the two (QM/MM). Static calculations obtain the property of the system at a fixed geometry, whereas dynamic calculations study the evolution of a system over a given timeframe. \r\n\r\nPython has become an integral part of computational modelling of materials in recent years, with development of packages such as the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) [1], which is a set of modules for manipulating, running and visualising atomic simulation. Furthermore, ASE integrates seamlessly with many electronic structure software packages, used for calculating the energy and properties of systems based on some level of theory, e.g Density Functional Theory (DFT), such as FHI-aims and VASP. [2,3] Moreover, the combination with other Python packages that integrate with ASE provide an ecosystem for atomic simulations (figure 1). Packages such as CatLearn, [4] a machine-learning approach used for determining transition states and energies needed for reactions, along with Phonopy and FHI-vibes, [5,6] both are for studying lattice dynamics of materials, and Py-ChemShell,[7] used for QM/MM calculations, to name a few, provide a comprehensive toolkit for the computational study of materials and chemical systems. \r\n\r\nIn our research, such approaches as outlined above are essential to further our understanding of materials and chemical processes, and of particular interest are materials for green and sustainable processes such as catalysts used for biofuel production, and battery materials, namely, zeolite Tin-BETA and Prussian Blue, [8-10] respectively. In collaboration with experimentalists, we seek to understand the synthetic methods and properties of these materials, with the aim to further establish them as viable alternatives to fossil fuels. In this regard, as Python software becomes increasingly popular for the simulation and study of materials, it also provides the tools and methods needed for tackling some of the grand challenges of today. \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n[1] A.

The particles that make up all of things we can touch and see only account for 5% of the energy density of the Universe. Leaving us quite literally in the dark! Weak gravitational lensing, a barely perceptible change to the shape of **galaxies** that we observe, is an indispensable tool for understanding the nature of **dark matter** and **dark energy**. However, measuring the shape of galaxies to the precision required is actually quite a tricky problem.\r\n\r\nWhat could be more interesting? üòÅ\r\n\r\n#### What does this have to do with Python?\r\n\r\nWell, Python has steadily become the standard programming language for cosmologists over the last decade or so... and we are no exception!

In my own adventures living in Zimbabwe, I‚Äôve always encountered ibises (the bird versions) perched on top of elephants. If you‚Äôve never seen an elephant in real life I can confirm that they are huge, complex creatures. The image of a small bird sitting on top of a large elephant serves as a metaphor for how ibis (the package) provides a less complex, more performant way for Pythonistas to interact with multiple big data engines. \r\n\r\nI'll use the metaphor of elephants and ibises to show how this package can make a data workflow more Pythonic. The Zen of Python lets us know that simple is better than complex. The bigger and more complex your data, the more of an argument there is to use Ibis. Raw SQL can be quite difficult to maintain when your queries are very complex. For Python programmers, Ibis offers a way to write SQL in Python that allows for unit-testing, composability, and abstraction over specific query engines (e.g.BigQuery)! You can carry out joins, filters, and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. Overall, using Ibis simplifies your workflows, makes you more productive, and keeps your code readable.",
    "description": "A few weeks ago I was working on setting up a relational database to explore records from DataSF‚Äôs Civic Art Collection. Whenever I attend a tech conference I try to spend a day or two in the city to check out its cultural scene, so this seemed like useful information! I decided to use MySQL as my database engine. Coming from a Pandas background I was surprised by how unproductive and restricted I felt writing raw SQL queries. I also spent a significant amount of time resolving errors in queries that worked with one flavor of SQL but failed with MySQL. Throughout the process, I kept thinking to myself if only there was a more Pythonic way!!! A few weeks later I was introduced to Ibis. \r\n\r\nI live in Zimbabwe and the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of the word ibis is a safari. One of my favorite things to do when I'm not working is to go on a game drive. Whenever I've been adventuring on safari I usually see ibises perched on top of an elephant. The contrast between the creatures is stark! The African Sacred Ibis is a small, elegant creature that's named after the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. While as many of us know, an elephant is a very big and complex animal. This image serves as a great metaphor for the Python package and how it interacts with big database engines.  \r\n\r\nIbis allows you to write intuitive Python code and have that code be translated into SQL. Whether you‚Äôre wanting to interact with SQL databases or wanting to use distributed DBMSs, Ibis lets you do this in Python. You can think of the python code as the less complex elegant layer sitting on top of any big data engine of your choice. At the moment, Ibis supports quite a few backends including:\r\n\r\nTraditional DBMSs: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite Analytical DBMSs: OmniSciDB, ClickHouse, Datafusion Distributed DBMSs: Impala, PySpark, BigQuery In memory analytics: pandas and Dask. \r\n\r\nAnything you can write in an SQL select statement you can write in Ibis. You can carry out joins, filters, and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. In this talk, we'll go through several examples of these and compare what the SQL code would look like versus writing to the database with Ibis. Overall, using Ibis simplifies your workflows, makes you more productive, and keeps your code readable.",

To do that we created extendable Python-based framework that allowed us to easily plug-in different Machine Translation engines and compare them across large variety of test datasets with a unified set of quality metrics. Our goal from the start was to create universal MT evaluation framework, that will be useful not only for healthcare domain, but to a wider community as well.\r\n\r\nAt this talk we will present our evaluation framework an will do a walk-through of its capabilities. We also cover how it can be extended to new MT engines, new test datasets and new language pairs. We will also present our evaluation results for several state-of-the-art machine translation engines, both open-source and cloud-based.\r\n\r\nAll the source code of our framework will be published in open-source by the time of the talk.",
    "description": "Task of Machine Translation engine evaluation may be very challenging. Quality of Machine Translation varies greatly depending on domain and language pair. Different MT engines may have different interfaces or APIs and different requirements to run. To add to that, even definition of a good translation may be debatable, with any automatic MT quality metric providing only approximation of actual translation quality. That's why having universal evaluation framework for this task is very important. In our work we tried to create such framework.\r\n\r\n1) We defined base translation class that unified all file handling, batch creation and result processing. As a result of that, only work needed to support new MT engine was creation of small child class that implemented couple of simple functions. That allows us to easily extend our framework to MT engines and new language pairs.\r\n\r\n2) We defined set of test datasets and provided a way to add new datasets to this set. For our evaluation our aim was to create test data that covers both general and healthcare domains  EMEA dataset (https://opus.nlpl.eu/EMEA.php), OPUS-100 (https://opus.nlpl.eu/opus-100.php), Paracrawl (https://paracrawl.eu/) and several others. But our data preparations scripts can be easily extended to other domains and datasets as well.\r\n\r\n3) We defined a set of quality metrics to evaluate results of MT engines. Metrics that we used included BLEU (https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu), BERTScore (https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score), ROUGE (https://github.com/pltrdy/rouge), TER and CHRF (both also from sacrebleu implementation).\r\n\r\nBeside MT evaluation framework we will present our own evaluation results. For our evaluation we used cloud based engines - Azure Translator (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator/), Google Translate (https://cloud.google.com/translate/), as well as open-source engines - Marian MT (https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/marian.html), NVIDIA's NeMo (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/nlp/machine_translation.html), Facebook's MBart 50 (https://huggingface.co/facebook/mbart-large-50-one-to-many-mmt), Facebook's M2M100 (https://huggingface.co/facebook/m2m100_418M). For open source engines we tried to use Huggingface's transformer implementation whenever possible. But as we mentioned our framework was designed in a way to be easily extendable to other MT engines and underlying frameworks.\r\n\r\nWe also will present evaluation results for NeMo and MarianMT engines that we fine-tuned specifically for healthcare domain. While these particular results may rather specific to our use case, they help to highlight how our framework can be extended to custom MT engines as well.",

Traditionally we use interaction information based on user preferences and item characteristics. This brings in collaborative filtering-driven recommendations with higher accuracy and relevance. However, such a method has certain limitations in utilizing implicit information like cross-domain specific factors that are equally important for making personalized recommendations. We propose an improvised way of using network embeddings based matrix factorization technique with multi-factors to make a match between both implicit and explicit features resulting in more accurate recommendation.",
    "description": "The method consists of three main steps: First, network embedding formulation performed on each user specific behavior network; Then, embeddings weight distribution estimated through intermediate layers of network with final layer for target (item purchased as labels); Finally, both factors: (a) Learned weights from implicit data (cross-domain) and (b) explicit factors from domain data used by multi-factorization method for recommendations. \r\nThe proposed method transfers knowledge across implicit and explicit factors and associated dimensions. The suggested approach tested real-world data with evidence of outperforming existing algorithms with significant lift in recommendation accuracy.

    "abstract": "Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms are one of the key service offerings for any cloud provider. To provide strong isolation, the functions are run inside heavy-weight virtual machines (and within containers inside those for orchestration reasons). Consequently, such instances take too long to boot and so are kept on all the time, even though the functions only receive requests intermittently. The end result is that current FaaS platforms are much less efficient than they could be.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce a radically novel way to build FaaS platforms based on Python and the Unikraft Linux Foundation open source project (www.unikraft.org). Unikraft is a toolkit for building fully specialized, cloud-ready virtual machines called unikernels targeting a single application . Using Unikraft we can construct extremely specialized, Python-based unikernels that use only a few MBs to run a boot in 10s of milliseconds, allowing us to bring VMs up as a request to a function comes in, and to shut it down (or suspend it) afterwards. The result: a Python-based FaaS platform that is significantly more efficient and cheaper to operate than existing offerings.\r\n\r\nIn the talk we will provide an introduction to Unikraft, how Python is built on top of it, a full description of the FaaS platform and a short demo.",
    "description": "Unikraft [1] is a unikernel (specialized virtual machine) project. Unikraft is able to target a specific application (e.g., a web server such as NGINX) and transparently build an entire software stack, from the operating system all the way up to systems libraries, that includes only the parts that the application needs and nothing more. Such specialization results in extremely short boot times (a few milliseconds compared to hundreds or thousands for Linux VMs), small image sizes and memory consumption (e.g., a few MBs vs. hundreds of MBs) and a minimal attack surface, to name a few benefits. The short boot times also allow us to bring Unikraft VMs up just-in-time, as a request for a service arrives, and to bring the instance back down (or suspend it) when the request is over, allowing for even greater efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Unikraft images are single address space: in cloud environments strong isolation is provided by the hypervisor, so for single application/single tenant VMs it does not make sense to have a kernel/user-space divide. The end result is higher efficiency in performance, with Unikraft yielding noticeably higher throughout than Linux [2].\r\n\r\nRegarding application support, we have put great effort towards making Unikraft as POSIX compatible as possible. Unikraft provides a syscall shim-layer and support for the musl libc, allowing us to run unmodified versions of Python. \r\n\r\nIn terms of orchestration, we have integrated Unikraft with major frameworks such as Kubernetes and Prometheus. This, along with extensive debugging facilities should make Unikraft easy to both use and develop for.\r\n\r\n[1] https://unikraft.org/\r\n[2] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456248 (best paper award)",

    "abstract": "In my talk, we explore our usage data requested according to GDPR and leverage it - together with Spotify‚Äôs Web API - to build a personalized playlist recommender system with Python.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective in the EU. It sometimes causes data scientists great headaches. But from a consumer and Pythonista point of view this can also be interesting data for exploration. It is very useful for building personalization technology, in particular recommender systems. And there are almost endless ways to use Python for it.\r\nSo, let‚Äôs request and use our own data to build a playlist recommender system which infers our music taste from our streaming history and uses it to retrieve songs from our favorites in a new way. We will call it ‚ÄúYour Rediscover Past‚Äù, a personalized playlist based on your streaming history and saved songs.",
    "description": "Personalized Playlist Recommendations on Spotify are great ‚Äì some of them let us discover new songs, some others help us to rediscover songs. However, rediscovery seems to be limited on the more recent past, i.e. going only a month backwards. This is a problem if you like to rediscover some of your favorite songs you might have listened to a longer while ago. Sometimes we add them to our \"liked songs\" where they likely fade away. However, you once explicitly declared those tracks as favorites. So, what is it that we can do about this missing piece in personalized playlist recommendations?\r\n\r\nWell, the first thing we do is to request our personal usage data from Spotify according to GDPR. Second, we analyze and enrich it with track audio features offered by Spotify‚Äôs rich Web API. We derive the music taste profile of ourselves from 12 months of streaming history and use this taste profile to retrieve favorite songs we haven‚Äôt listened to for more than a year. In my talk, I present you the Python package I build for this purpose, possible extensions and enable you to create your own personalized playlist to rediscover your past!",

    "abstract": "The human brain excels at finding patterns in visual representations, which is why data visualizations are essential to any analysis. Done right, they bridge the gap between those analyzing the data and those consuming the analysis. However, learning to create impactful, aesthetically-pleasing visualizations can often be challenging. This session will equip you with the skills to make customized visualizations for your data using Python.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many plotting libraries to choose from, the prolific Matplotlib library is always a great place to start. Since various Python data science libraries utilize Matplotlib under the hood, familiarity with Matplotlib itself gives you the flexibility to fine tune the resulting visualizations (e.g., add annotations, animate, etc.). This session will also introduce interactive visualizations using HoloViz, which provides a higher-level plotting API capable of using Matplotlib and Bokeh (a Python library for generating interactive, JavaScript-powered visualizations) under the hood.",
    "description": "#### Section 1: Getting Started With Matplotlib\r\nWe will begin by familiarizing ourselves with Matplotlib. Moving beyond the default options, we will explore how to customize various aspects of our visualizations. By the end of this section, you will be able to generate plots using the Matplotlib API directly, as well as customize the plots that libraries like pandas and Seaborn create for you.\r\n\r\n#### Section 2: Moving Beyond Static Visualizations\r\nStatic visualizations are limited in how much information they can show. To move beyond these limitations, we can create animated and/or interactive visualizations. Animations make it possible for our visualizations to tell a story through movement of the plot components (e.g., bars, points, lines). Interactivity makes it possible to explore the data visually by hiding and displaying information based on user interest. In this section, we will focus on creating animated visualizations using Matplotlib before moving on to create interactive visualizations in the next section.\r\n\r\n#### Section 3: Building Interactive Visualizations for Data Exploration\r\nWhen exploring our data, interactive visualizations can provide the most value. Without having to create multiple iterations of the same plot, we can use mouse actions (e.g., click, hover, zoom, etc.) to explore different aspects and subsets of the data. In this section, we will learn how to use a few of the libraries in the HoloViz ecosystem to create interactive visualizations for exploring our data utilizing the Bokeh backend.",

They are such a terrible waste of pixels, after all.\r\n- Flagging the use of list() instead of []. The former is slower ‚Äì as it requires an extra lookup in \"globals\" ‚Äì and might result in a bug if the name is rebound to another object.\r\n- Find if statements are nested for more than four levels.

Property-based tests generate the inputs for you and in many cases they‚Äôre more likely to find invalid inputs than humans. The difficulty lies in formulating these test cases.\r\n\r\nAfter this workshop you‚Äôll be comfortable with property-based testing using Hypothesis. You‚Äôll have experience requesting appropriate test data from Hypothesis and in writing tests for common and more advanced properties. At work, your co-workers will be impressed by your unbreakable code ;)\r\n\r\nParticipants are expected to have basic familiarity with unit testing and a testing framework.

This situation has frustrated users for a long time and has forced everyone into learning ‚Äúwhat the interpreter really wants to say‚Äù or ‚Äúwhere the error really could be‚Äù. This problem is especially acquitted for first-time learners of the language as they can lose a lot of time trying to decipher what the error messages they just got mean and where the problem may be.",
    "description": "Python 3.10 has been recently released and among many exciting new features, one of the biggest improvements is the inclusion of a whole new set of changes focused on improving the error messages across the interpreter and the general user experience when dealing with error messages. The new error messages have been one of the most welcomed features from very different sets of users ranging from Python teachers and educators, first-time learners, industry professionals and data scientists.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will cover:\r\n\r\n* What are the new improvements featured in Python 3.10.\r\n* Exciting new changes and improvements that will feature in Python 3.11.\r\n* How these improvements are useful to different sets of users from people learning Python to experienced programmers.\r\n* How the new PEG parser has unlocked adding new custom syntax errors.\r\n* How these improvements were implemented and what challenges the CPython core team faced to get them working reliably.\r\n* How users can contribute to adding new error messages: what is the workflow, how the errors are reviewed by the core team and where to find resources and help.\r\n\r\nNo matter who you are and what you do with Python, there is an improvement that will probably make you smile.",

    "abstract": "The Blue Brain Project strives to simulate the whole mouse brain. The amount of data and code this implies is astoundingly high, and it requires the development of software tools that have both a strict and clear structure and that are resilient to errors that will manifest when developing complex code. Workflows are a straightforward way to maintain structure in toolchains that grow increasingly complex. Workflow management packages such as Luigi bring functionality to run different tasks in parallel, keep track of completed tasks and improve the reproducibility. This poster will present two Blue Brain Project software tools, the e-model-packages software and BluePyEModel, focusing on the creation and distribution of in-silico neuron cells. The e-model-packages software collects cells from an in-silico brain circuit and arranges them in individual ‚Äòneuron packages‚Äô to be distributed to the public through the Blue Brain online portals. The cells packages it creates are designed to be easily run with the open source EModelRunner package. The BluePyEModel software creates and optimizes in-silico neurons and is able to reproduce features from real neuronal experiment recordings. Under the hood, it uses the open source BluePyEfe and eFel packages to extract the electrophysiological features from experimental cells, and the open source BluePyOpt simulator to optimize and validate the parameters of the in-silico neurons.",

    "abstract": "The Blue Brain Project hosts several online portals from which users can download single neuron model implementations. These contain the information necessary to simulate the electrical behavior of a neuron. EModelRunner is a Python library that provides a unified interface to the users to run these downloaded models. It gives the users the ability to customize the properties of the neurons, apply various stimuli in order to observe the corresponding behavior, or activate the synapses that are present on the morphology of the neuron. This way neuroscientists can investigate the neurons in a self-contained environment and conduct digital experiments on them.",
    "description": "The brain is undoubtedly the most complex organ in the human body. Over the decades, scientists have been using theoretical and experimental approaches to understand the brain. With the recent advancement of computer systems and the availability of big data, a new discipline, namely simulation neuroscience, is emerged as a complementary approach alongside experimental, theoretical and clinical neuroscience. As the name suggests, simulation neuroscience attempts to understand the brain by simulating it in a computer.\r\nHere we present EModelRunner, a Python package designed to run the simulated neuron model implementations provided by the Blue Brain Project online portals. It is capable of simulating biologically detailed neuron models. A neuron model describes a single cell in the brain and consists of a morphology and equations that simulate its electrical behavior. EModelRunner uses the Neuron simulator under the hood. The Neuron simulator is implemented in C++, but also provides a Python interface to the user. For computing the properties of the membrane channels, Neuron uses compiled mechanisms written using the Neuron Model Description Language (NMODL). EModelRunner abstracts away the Neuron and NMODL implementation layers from the end-users and provides them with a pure Python API. It supplies the users with the ability to customize the properties of the neurons and apply various stimuli to them in order to observe their behavior. Another use-case for the EModelRunner is to provide a standard way of running the neuron models provided by the Blue Brain Project.",

Numerical solvers are embedded into Docker containers and provide an isolated and reproducible environment exposing a language-agnostic REST API. A model registry enables efficient queries of models. The overall system is represented as a collection of models that exchange data. Then, the design optimization involves execution of a dependency tree of models to study the impact of a parameter change and perform its optimization. In this contribution, we present a model query mechanism allowing notebook models to query one another. The model dependencies are represented with a graph with suitable processing algorithms. In order to ensure that only affected models are executed we derive and cache a model resolution order. The presented modelling framework relies on open source-technologies (packages: pydantic, Fast API, Jupyter, papermill, scrapbook, containers: Docker and Openshift as well as databases: MongoDB and Redis) and the talk will focus on good practices and design decisions encountered in the process.",

The MASQUE protocol can tunnel traffic through HTTP/3 or HTTP/2, but common Python libraries only support HTTP/1.1. The tunneled traffic can use any protocol on top of TCP or UDP, including all HTTP versions, so MASQUE can be proxied through MASQUE for onion routing.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will show that the MASQUE proxy design is simple and yet client implementations are complex. To put everything into context, I will recap how HTTP proxies operate and how HTTP versions differ. I will highlight lessons learned from designing a low-level HTTP client using Python asyncio.",

    "description": "Many teams document the conventions for their projects. However, documentation gets out of date, forgotten, or sometimes ignored. Simple documentation requires team members to constantly remember all the ‚Äòrules‚Äô for your project. You can better enforce those rules and free up your team members to think about harder problems using linting tools like flake8, import linter, and pre-commit.\r\n\r\nThese tools provide tons of useful stuff out of the box, but you can push them so much further with customization. This allows your project to formally document conventions, but also enforce them automatically on every commit, merge, and build. This can make code reviews faster and more focused on the problems your code is meant to solve.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce tools like flake8, import linter, and pre-commit along with some of their built-in functionality. Then, we‚Äôll briefly explore some ways to customize them to fit your projects‚Äô specific needs. Some examples of custom linter rules we‚Äôll tour are:\r\n\r\n- Code formatted automatically and uniformly\r\n- Code doesn‚Äôt import across architecture layers violating separation of concerns\r\n- Common conventions are used\r\n- Common anti-patterns are avoided\r\n- Specific layers are fully tested\r\n- Proper git commit message formatting\r\n- Merge commits don‚Äôt exist in topic/feature branches\r\n\r\nFinally, we‚Äôll discuss ways to use those custom linter rules on every commit, merge, and build with continuous integration or git hooks.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you‚Äôll see several real-world linter rules used on Kraken, which is a large Django-based project used to supply green energy to millions of users across the world.

This project consists of a set of experiments on similar data-sets from news\r\nagencies across the various subsets in the ‚Äùmedia-bias‚Äù chart. News Media perceived bias\r\nis common across consumers that belong to various political affiliations. While anecdotal\r\nevidence of this exists and there exist annotated datasets that aim to annotate the ‚Äùspin‚Äù\r\na news agency puts on certain events and entities, whether this is a widespread problem\r\nand whether it can be detected by the neural network topically or temporally is a problem that needs to be explored. The news media bias analysis is modelled as a Natural\r\nLanguage Processing sentiment analysis task and a fake news binary classification task to\r\ndeduce the level of polarization in a neural network by feeding it headlines embedded using\r\npre-trained sentiment models from news publications across the political spectrum. When\r\nit came to fake news vulnerability, news from all kinds of perceived politically affiliated\r\nnews media holds up well against a fake news dataset with a very good accuracy. None of\r\nthe accuracies dropped below 95%. This is a significant result that sort of debunks the AllSlides categorization",
    "description": "This work is an example of an intersection of a non\r\nscientific field with computer science and mathematics, trying to quantify, measure and identify\r\nnon mathematical phenomena in the language of mathematics. It is important because it could\r\nbe the basis of the scientific approaches that the next generation policy makers, voters, non\r\nprofit social organizations and governments could use to make life changing decisions for their\r\ncitizens.\r\n2\r\nThe questions that this study tries to answer is whether a neural network can learn biases from\r\nthe news media based on perceived bias scores obtained from independent agencies. It also\r\nseeks to answer whether any of these political leanings of the news media affect the vulnerability of their consumer when it comes to fake news. The results of this experiment aim to show\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n1. SVMs perform better clustering with respect to the categories than neural networks, however the maximum does not cross 67%\r\n2. The most significant conclusion from this work is that though there is a perceived bias\r\nwhen it comes to news agencies, when looked at from a neural networks standpoint, it\r\nis negligible. Mainstream news agencies are not able to polarize a neural network with\r\ninherent biases in their headlines.\r\n3. There may be topical biases that need to be examined by using an Entity linking and bias\r\ncalculation approach\r\n4. Most mainstream news agencies do not make the consumer vulnerable to believing fake\r\nnews. This study needs to be conducted with data from popular social media ‚Äùnews‚Äù\r\ngroups or popular TV shows that masquerade as news but may technically not even be\r\nnews channels.\r\n5. It is safe to conclude that the perceived bias that stems from social media polarization is\r\nbeing extended to news media when their contribution to the polarization may be negligible.",

We will use Python as our weapon of choice to slowly discuss how you would \r\ngo about building the different components of a database.\r\n\r\n1) Talking to your Database: We start by building out an interface and a language that helps us communicate with our database. We will use the Prompt toolkit to build a REPL & use a simple SQL-based language with basic regular expressions that can parse it to instruction to execute.\r\n\r\n2) Working with Data: Now that we can communicate with our database using instructions. we start the actual work in building out the Datastore, We initially store all the data in a simple in-memory dictionary and then move to persist this data to disk. We now read the data from the disk to memory every time we query the data and write back the data to the disk but this makes things very slow :(\r\nThis problem is our entry into the beautiful world of Indexes so by building a very basic Btree index to store references in memory to quickly access only what we require from the data on disk we can actually speed up our access times for basic row access queries from O(N) to O(1) where N is the number of rows in a table\r\n\r\n3) Future: We can now proudly demo our new and polished database that can store data, persist it, and can run queries that are quite fast thanks to our Btree Indexes. We also discuss how this Database can be improved in the future by supporting full ACID Transactions, allowing concurrency, and handling locks\r\n\r\nOur Database journey now comes to an End and As they say, The best way to understand something is to build it yourself :)",

Add superpowers to your iPhone app with Python!\r\n\r\nNative mobile applications have many advantages over mobile websites or apps made with cross-platform toolkits. They will use less battery, allow for richer graphics, more consistent UI behavior, and enable more functionality through device-specific APIs. Wouldn't it be great to have access to all this from Python?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll marry a native iOS app written in Swift with an embedded Python 3.10 interpreter to allow users to customize what the application is doing. We'll go through the entire process of:\r\n\r\n- embedding Python from source;\r\n- building it into the Swift mobile app in Xcode;\r\n- adding a few pre-compiled third-party libraries like numpy and Pillow to broaden the scope of what the user can do;\r\n- running the resulting app on an iPhone 13;\r\n- modifying the app behavior at runtime thanks to our new Python superpowers!\r\n\r\nKnowledge of Swift is not required for attendees of this talk. However, it will be needed later if you're willing to embed Python in an iPhone app. Embedding Python doesn't really let you make an app without knowing Swift. Don't fret though! It's pretty easy to get a hang of Swift when you're fluent in Python.",

The extra work needed to do the right thing competes with the almost overwhelming need for new development, and unclear code ownership and lack of insight into the size and scope of type problems add to the burden. We‚Äôve greatly mitigated these problems by building an automated refactoring pipeline that applies Black formatting and backfills missing types via incremental Github pull requests. Our refactor applications use LibCST and MonkeyType to modify the Python syntax tree and use GitPython/PyGithub to create and manage pull requests. It divides changes into small, easily reviewed pull requests and assigns appropriate code owners to review them. After creating and merging more than 3,000 pull requests, we have fully converted our large codebase to Black format and have added type annotations to more than 50,000 functions. In this talk, you‚Äôll learn to use LibCST to build automated refactoring tools that fix general Python code quality issues at scale and how to use GitPython/PyGithub to automate the code review process.",

    "abstract": "Python has had a transformational effect on countless fields so far, but its permeation can be accelerated through the integration of Python into non-computing coursework. Currently, Python‚Äôs presence within secondary and post-secondary schools varies greatly between different institutions, but the continuity in the lack of interdisciplinary coursework is a key limiting factor in the widespread growth of computing education. This is due to a variety of factors, including stereotypes and policy issues, but the bottom line is that Python being restricted to only computing classes restricts career opportunities and misrepresents the professional world. With support from a case-study of college-level physics students exposed to scientific programming, we propose novel methods of integrating Python into traditional coursework during this talk. The overarching mission of this discussion is to demonstrate how Python literacy in non-computing coursework can ultimately help in streamlining processes and accelerating progress in various industries. Attendees will have the opportunity to hear about the exciting prospect of expanding Python beyond the confines of computer science, and will have an exclusive look at a case-study that offers insight into student benefits of integrated coursework: as concerned stakeholders, it is ultimately well-informed Python community members who must unite to make a positive impact on the education system.",
    "description": "Introduction and Motivation: \r\n\r\nThe goal of many within the Python community has been to increase the reach of computer science education in classrooms and institutions around the world. Various studies have pointed out the problem-solving and planning abilities forged by computer science coursework (Salehi et al., 2020; Arf√© et al., 2020), and other research has investigated the social stigma (McCartney et al., 2017) and instructor bottlenecks (Raman et al., 2015) that inhibit accessibility to computer science courses. In recent years, significant steps have been taken towards increasing computer science education. However, most of these efforts are largely focused on the introduction of standalone computer science courses rather than integrated coursework.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we explore the seldom-discussed idea of integrating programming into traditional, non-computing fields such as mathematics, social studies, and science. Interdisciplinary coursework is not a new concept in education: students in an English class are expected to be able to understand, produce, and analyze data visualizations, and mathematics students learn to communicate their work formally in language (Lynch, 2020). However, the current belief in the education realm is that computer science is only for a small sect of highly capable students expressing a deep career interest in the field, a clear misconception that has been debunked by studies (Patitsas et al., 2019) and the experiences of countless professionals applying computational resources in traditionally non-computing industries. As a result of such factors, computer science education is fundamentally isolated from the core curriculum, which is to the detriment of learners and the fields that they pursue. \r\n\r\nIn support of the discussion, we unveil the results of surveys given to physics students enrolled in college-level coursework. In this case-study, students of varied backgrounds in computing are given a lecture on chaotic dynamical systems, and are then shown Python-implemented Runge-Kutta numerical integration methods and simulations to solve and visualize the systems. The insights provided by these students provide great perspective on benefits, reception, and nuances in integrating Python into core classes. Overwhelmingly, many indicated that they believed that the Python demonstrations aided in their understanding of the material. For the attendee, this exclusive look at a case-study will help develop a well-informed perspective on the role of Python beyond just computer science.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the presentation with recommendations for integrated Python coursework, calling for global policymakers and Python community members to step forward and do their part as stakeholders. We pinpoint why Python is the best choice, touching on factors such as its readable syntax, high volume of functional open-source libraries, ever-growing industry demand. The versatility afforded by such elements makes learners of all backgrounds better equipped for solving the challenging problems they will face in their careers. Community members in attendance will gain essential knowledge regarding the issue of Python integration, making them better equipped to argue on behalf of the educational community.\r\n\r\nFor students, seeing how complex differential equations can be numerically approached and solved by computers, understanding how new solar systems are discovered by crunching vast astronomical data, and witnessing a computer rapidly sequence a lengthy DNA chain forges an instant, permanent connection that fosters career interests and prepares students for an increasingly computerized professional world. We seek to advocate for every student to have this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe key takeaway for talk attendees will be a fresh perspective on the issue of Python‚Äôs absence beyond the confines of computer science coursework, as well as methods for mitigation and steps that they can take. Changing education with programming is a long-term investment that will unequivocally accelerate student preparedness and capabilities, but it begins with the focused efforts of an informed public rallying in support of progress. \r\n\r\nSchedule and Format:\r\n\r\n5 minutes: The problem of computer science in education and why we should focus on increasing Python‚Äôs role in non-computing classes\r\n\r\n10 minutes: Presenting research: a case study on introducing scientific Python to physics students\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Why Python is the best option and the role and impact on the Python community\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Proposals for Solutions to the Problem\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Question and Answer Session",
