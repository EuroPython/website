## Which ticket type do I need to buy?

We would like to encourage and trust you, to pick a ticket type that reasonably fits your personal situation.

- **Company**: If a company is paying for your ticket and you need a proper VAT Invoice, please buy a business ticket; The personal tickets do not include a company name. 

- **Personal**: If you are using Python as a hobby or as freelancer and don't need a VAT Invoice, the personal ticket is for you.

- **Sudent**: Finally, if you are a student/postdoc researcher working in academia, we have the highly subsidised student ticket for you.

*Please note: we will list the ticket type on the badge to make things easier for the registration desk staff.

If you would like to support EuroPython and what we do for the community, please consider getting a higher priced ticket. Thank you!

We would like to encourage you to book your ticket early. This makes it easier for us to plan for the event and arrange e.g. the catering, badge printing, etc.

If you have any questions, please check our [FAQ document](https://ep2022.europython.eu/faq). If you still have questions, don't hesitate to email our [EuroPython Helpdesk](helpdesk@europython.eu).
