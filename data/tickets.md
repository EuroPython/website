## Which Ticket Tier Should I buy?

EuroPython is organised by volunteers and a community-led conference. We encourage and trust you to pick a fair ticket tier that fits your personal circumstance. The money you spend will be put straight back to the community to support our diversity initiatives, Financial Aid Programme and other grants offered to the European Python community. 

- **Business Tickets**: If your company/business is paying for you or if you use Python professionally.
  - If you are in a position to afford a business ticket, you are helping us keep the conference affordable for everything, and are supporting our [Financial Aid](https://ep2022.europython.eu/finaid) and other Grant Programmes](https://www.europython-society.org/grants/).
- **Personal Tickets**: If you enjoy Python as a hobbyist or a freelancer.
- **Student Tickets**: If you are a pupil, student and if your institution cannot cover a higher tier for you to attend. 
  - This is a highly subsidised rate for students/adademics who cannot otherwise afford a Personal or a Business ticket.

**Note**: If you need a proper VAT invoice listing your company's name, please purchase a Business Ticket. The Personal Tickets do not include a company name. We will list the Ticket Tier and Type on your conference badge for accommodate the registration staff.
