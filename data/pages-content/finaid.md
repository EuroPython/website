## Grant Eligibility

Our grants are open to everyone in need of financial support to participate in
EuroPython. We will look at the following criteria to help decide who qualifies
for a grant:

1. **Contributors:** We want to support those who make the Python community
   a positive, inclusive and welcoming space. We welcome grant applications
   from folks who need financial support and who clearly put effort into
   the community and EuroPython, including speakers, volunteers, community
   organizers, and open-source contributors.
2. **Economic factors:** Everyone should have a chance to attend EuroPython,
   regardless of their economic situation.
3. **Diversity:** We want EuroPython to be the most diverse and inclusive event
   possible, and we especially want to help those from under-represented groups
   in tech feel welcomed, be present in and contribute to our community.
