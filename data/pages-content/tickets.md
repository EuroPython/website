## The What, Where and When of EuroPython 2022

EuroPython 2022 will be held on 11-17th July. It will be both in person and
virtual. In person, it will be held at
[The Convention Centre Dublin (The CCD)](https://www.theccd.ie/), Ireland.
Details of the virtual conference will be published soon.

The conference will follow this broad plan of events:

-   Two Workshop/Tutorial Days (11-12 July, Mon-Tue)
-   Three Conference Days (13-15 July, Wed-Fri)
-   Sprint Weekend (16-17 July, Sat-Sun)

## Ticket Types

We understand attendees have different needs, so we've created three types of
ticket to give folks maximum flexibility and value for money:

<ul>
<li><b>Conference Tickets (in-person & remote)</b>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>In-person</b>: Access to Conference & Sprint Weekend (13-17 July).There will be limited access to specific sponsored/special workshops during the Workshop/Tutorial Days (11-12 July).</li>
    <li className="new"><b>Remote</b>: remote participation during the Conference Days (Wednesday-Friday): watch the live talks, keynotes & panels in all 6 tracks, participate in lightning talks, engage in live Q&A (with voice and video), and interact with available speakers in breakout discussions. Participation during sprint days is to be determined.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

-   **Tutorial Tickets (in-person only)**: Access to Workshop/Tutorial Days (11-12 July) and the
    Sprint Weekend (16-17 July), but **NOT** the main conference (13-15 July).
-   **Combined Tickets (in-person only)**: Access to everything during the whole seven-day
    event (11-17 July).

## Which Ticket Tier Should I buy?

Each of the three ticket types is available in three payment tiers.

We encourage and trust you to pick a fair ticket tier that fits your personal
circumstance. The money you spend will be put straight back into the community
to support our diversity initiatives,
[financial aid programmes](/finaid) and
[other grants](https://www.europython-society.org/grants/)
offered to the European Python community.

-   **Business Tickets**: for attendees whose company/business is paying for
    them to attend, or if you use Python professionally. As someone with the
    means to afford this tier you help us keep the conference affordable for
    everyone. Thank you!
-   **Personal Tickets**: for those who enjoy Python as a hobbyist or use it as
    a freelancer.
-   **Education Tickets**: for students, and teachers working in the education
    sector (your main employment is at a school, college or university).

**Note**: If you need a proper VAT invoice listing your company's name, please
purchase a business ticket. Personal Tickets do not include a company name. We
will list the ticket tier and type on your conference badge to accommodate the
registration staff.

You are not required to register a ticket to access these livestreams. If you would like an email reminder or receive up-to-date information about the conference, you are welcome to register for a free livestream-only ticket.

Note: The free livestream-only ticket does not include support and you will be unable to interact with the speakers or other in-person audience. Consider getting a remote ticket instead.

    badge printing, and a million other things you'd never imagine would be
    involved in organising a conference.
