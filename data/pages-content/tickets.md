## The What, Where and When of EuroPython 2023

EuroPython 2023 will be held on 17-23 July. In person, it will be held at
the [Prague Congress Centre (PCC)](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage), the Czech Republic.
Details of how to participate remotely will be published soon.

The conference will follow this broad plan of events:

- Two Workshop/Tutorial Days (17-18 July, Mon-Tue)
- Three Conference Days (19-21 July, Wed-Fri)
- Sprint Weekend (22-23 July, Sat-Sun)

## Ticket Types

We understand attendees have different needs, so we've created three types of
ticket to give folks maximum flexibility and value for money:

- **Conference Tickets**: Access to Conference & Sprint Weekend (19-23 July).
  There will be limited access to specific sponsored/special workshops during
  the Workshop/Tutorial Days (17-18 July).
- **Tutorial Tickets**: Access to Workshop/Tutorial Days (17-18 July) and the
  Sprint Weekend (22-23 July), but **NOT** the main conference (19-21 July).
- **Combined Tickets**: Access to everything during the whole seven-day
  event (17-23 July).

## Which Ticket Tier Should I buy?

Each of the three ticket types is available in three payment tiers.

We encourage and trust you to pick a fair ticket tier that fits your personal
circumstance. The money you spend will be put straight back into the community
to support our diversity initiatives,
[financial aid programmes](https://ep2023.europython.eu/finaid) and
[other grants](https://www.europython-society.org/grants/)
offered to the European Python community.

- **Business Tickets**: for attendees whose company/business is paying for
  them to attend, or if you use Python professionally. As someone with the
  means to afford this tier you help us keep the conference affordable for
  everyone. Thank you!
- **Personal Tickets**: for those who enjoy Python as a hobbyist or use it as
  a freelancer.
- **Education Tickets**: for students, and teachers working in the education
  sector (your main employment is at a school, college or university). We offer Education Tickets below costs.

**Note**: If you need a proper VAT invoice listing your company's name, please
purchase a business ticket. Personal Tickets do not include a company name. We
will list the ticket tier and type on your conference badge to accommodate the
registration staff.
