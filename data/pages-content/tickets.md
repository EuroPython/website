## The What, Where and When of EuroPython 2023

EuroPython 2023 will be held on 17-23 July. In person, it will be held at
the [Prague Congress Centre (PCC)](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage), the Czech Republic.
Details of how to participate remotely will be published soon.

The conference will follow this broad plan of events:

- Two Workshop/Tutorial Days (17-18 July, Mon-Tue)
- Three Conference Days (19-21 July, Wed-Fri)
- Sprint Weekend (22-23 July, Sat-Sun)

## Ticket Types

We understand attendees have different needs, so we've created three types of
ticket to give folks maximum flexibility and value for money:

- **Conference Tickets**: Access to Conference & Sprint Weekend (19-23 July).
  There will be limited access to specific sponsored/special workshops during
  the Workshop/Tutorial Days (17-18 July).
- **Tutorial Tickets**: Access to Workshop/Tutorial Days (17-18 July) and the
  Sprint Weekend (22-23 July), but **NOT** the main conference (19-21 July).
- **Combined Tickets**: Access to everything during the whole seven-day
  event (17-23 July).

  **Note**: Every ticket includes break refreshments and a light lunch for each day during the Tutorial & Conference Days (17-21 July). Food details for Sprint Weekend TBD.

## Which Ticket Tier Should I buy?

Each of the three ticket types is available in three payment tiers.

We encourage and trust you to pick a fair ticket tier that fits your personal
circumstance. The money you spend will be put straight back into the community
to support our diversity initiatives,
[financial aid programmes](https://ep2023.europython.eu/finaid) and
[other grants](https://www.europython-society.org/grants/)
offered to the European Python community.

- **Business Tickets**: if your company/business pays for you to attend, or if you use Python professionally. When you purchase a Business Ticket, you help us keep the conference affordable for everyone. Thank you!
- **Personal Tickets**: if you enjoy Python as a hobbyist or use it as a freelancer.
- **Education Tickets**: If you are a student, or a teacher working in the education sector (your main employment is at a school, college or university). We subsidise Education Tickets to make it accessible to everyone.

**Note**: If you need a proper VAT invoice listing your company's name, please
purchase a Business Ticket. Personal Tickets do not include a company name. We
will list the ticket tier and type on your conference badge to accommodate the
registration staff.

  - get 15 business tickets of any type for the price of 11

 **Note**: if you mix & match between different ticket types in a volume order, you will always get the cheapest for free.
