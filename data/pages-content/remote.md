# EuroPython 2022 Hybrid

As happy as we are about finally being able to see many friends in **Dublin**
this year, we are also aware that many of you will not be able to make it in-person.
Following the two successful years of running EuroPython online, and making so many
precious memories and friends from all over the world, we present you EuroPython 2022 Hybrid:
wherever you are based, let's celebrate Python and our community, rejoice at our diversity and
learn and have fun in Dublin and beyond! In this spirit, we strive to make the remote participation
as interactive as possible.
