# EuroPython 2023 Hybrid

As happy as we are about finally being able to see many friends in **Prague**
this year, we are also aware that many of you will not be able to make it
in-person. Following the two successful years of running EuroPython online, and
making so many precious memories and friends from all over the world, we present
you EuroPython 2023 Hybrid: wherever you are based, let's celebrate Python and
our community, rejoice at our diversity and learn and have fun in Dublin and
beyond! In this spirit, we strive to make the remote participation as
interactive as possible.

### How to participate in the conference remotely?

- To participate in the conference interactively (with guaranteed access to
  livestreams), a "remote ticket" registration is required. See details and
  pricing on the [Buy Tickets](/tickets#remote-tickets) page;
- Any ticket (except the Stream-only) will have a link to join our remote
  platform Venueless. Just open your ticket and click on the link to join. There
  is no user or password, the link is your password. Each ticket can allow 3
  simultaneous sessions. If you join with more than 3 devices, the oldest will
  be logged out.

_Note: in-person ticket holders will be provided with remote event access_

### What is included in the remote ticket?

- Livestreams of Keynotes, Panel discussions, all 6 tracks of talks.
- Participation of Lightning Talks
- Live participation ((with video and audio) of every QA session post talk.
- Breakout discussions with available speakers.
- On-Demand viewing will be available with a couple hours after the live stream

_Note: Tutorials and Workshops will not be streamed._

### Livestreams without interaction

As per our tradition, we also provide open and free access to the livestreams of
our conference talks (13-15 July). You are not required to register a ticket,
but you are welcome to if you would like an email reminder or receive up-to-date
information about the conference.

But The free livestream-only ticket does not include support and you will be
unable to interact with the speakers or other in-person audience. Consider
getting a remote ticket instead.
