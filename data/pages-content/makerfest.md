## MakerFest

Thanks to MicroPython, embedded devices, wearables, and other funky hardware projects are a reality for Pythonistas. Making, exploring and sharing such cool stuff is what the MakerFest is all about.
Don’t just use Python to blink an LED… the Pythonic embedded world is so much more interactive, connected and empowering than most realise, with the only limit being your imagination.

If you’re a Maker, educator, or just interested in planning, putting together and programming “things”, then our MakerFest is for you!

**NOTE: You will need to have a conference ticket to attend MakerFest.**
