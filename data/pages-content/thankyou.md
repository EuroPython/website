# Thank you

It's a wrap! EuroPython 2022 in Dublin is now over. If you missed it or would like to see it again, you can check the [photos] or [videos], our [blog] or other [social] [media].

None of it would be possible without the team of volunteers that spent countless hours making it happen.
If you'd like to join one of the teams and help with future conferences please send us an email [volunteers@europython.eu].


## EuroPython Society Board

The legal entity behind EuroPython conference is EuroPython Society.
It's daily operations are managed by an elected board.
Venue selection and everything accounting, finance & legal related is handled by the board.
The board changes every year, and most of the work related to the 2022 conference was done by the 2022 board, however the venue selection, signing contracts and lots of other prep work was done already by the 2020 board.
