# Thank YOU

The journey to Prague encompassed a full year of exploration, diligent effort, and unwavering dedication. Our exceptional team made it together with warmth, compassion, humour and creativity! A heartfelt appreciation extends to all those who took part in crafting EuroPython 2023 Prague & Remote.

EuroPython 2023 was organised entirely by a devoted group of volunteers, a tradition upheld since 2002. Without further ado, let us meet the fantastic humans who dedicated numerous hours and boundless affection into shaping EuroPython 2023!
