# Thank you

The journey to Dublin was a 2-year arduous wait. But we made it together and it's a wrap! Big thanks to everyone who co-created EuroPython 2022, in Dublin & Remote.

EuroPython 2022 was run solely by a group of dedicated volunteers, as it has been every year since 2002. Without further ado, let's meet the amazing humans who spent countless hours & poured endless love into making EuroPython 2022!


## EuroPython Society Board

The annually elected EuroPython Society (EPS) Board manages the day-to-day operations of the EPS, the legal entity behind the EuroPython conference series. The EPS 2022 Board were responsible for most of the fiscal, legal and venue related work for the EuroPython 2022 conference. But due to the 2-year wait to Dublin as a result of COVID, we are very grateful to the EPS 2020 Board for the great deal of prep work they conducted for the Dublin conference, including venue & supplier selections and contract negotiations.
