# Sprints #

Sprints will be run on the conference weekend: Saturday & Sunday 16 & 17 Jul on the conference venue.

As is tradition, sprints are not organised by the conference organisers, but instead run by the participants who want to put on a sprint. We only provide the rooms and guidance on how to run the sprints.


## What is a “Sprint” ?

Most open source software development happens on the internet and developers usually communicate online only when working on projects. This usually works out fine, but the lack of live meetings can sometimes be a limiting factor in making good progress.

For this reason, a form of impromptu coding meetups called “sprints” or “hackathons” (outside the Python community, the term “hackathon” is more common) were initiated, where developers interested in a project can get together for a short period of time to make quick progress. Since conferences provide the perfect occasion to meet, sprints are made part of the conference program.

## Organising a Sprint

We have 3 rooms at The CCD dedicated to the sprint weekend:
- Liffey Hall 1, at Level 1; capacity: 50
- Liffey Hall 2, at Level 1; capacity: 50
- Wicklow Hall 2, at Level 2; capacity: 200

If you are planing to run a sprint at EuroPython 2022, please add it at the bottom of this page [creating a PR to our website](https://github.com/EuroPython/website/blob/main/data/pages-content/sprints.md)

Remember to announce it on the social channels too!

Many thanks !
