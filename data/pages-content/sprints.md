# EuroPython 2023 Sprints #

EuroPython 2023 Sprints will be during the weekend 22-23 July. This year, we are hosting the sprint weekend at a **different venue** and it will be free for anyone to join!

As per our tradition, the conference organisers will provide the rooms and facilities but the sprints are organised by **YOU**. It is a great chance to contribute to open-source projects large and small, learn from each other, geek out and have fun. üêç

**When**: 22-23 July 2023

**Where**: Rajska Building (RB), [≈Ωi≈ækov Campus, V≈†E](https://www.vse.cz/english/about-vse/profile/campus/) (Prague University of Economics and Business)
- **sprint rooms** - all on the 1st floor of RB
- **chillout area**: the [atrium](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qKwC7fmxupRINP5Pvj6Npe_eq0czI6Y/view?usp=sharing) on the ground floor of RB

<!-- TODO: link map / page about sprint venue -->
**Who can attend**:
- If you have an in-person EuroPython ticket ([Conference, Tutorial or Combined](s#ticket-types)), then access to the sprints is already included. Remember to select your sprints attendance when buying / configuring your ticket, to let the organisers know.

## What is a ‚ÄúSprint‚Äù ?

 ‚ÄúSprints‚Äù or ‚Äúhackathons‚Äù a form of impromptu coding meetups, where anyone interested in a project can come together for a short period of time to make quick progress, share our knowledge and ideas and solve problems together. The two-day sprint is the perfect way to end the full-week EuroPython conference, giving you a hands-on experience to solidify what we have learned, and bond over our love for coding, making and problem solving.
