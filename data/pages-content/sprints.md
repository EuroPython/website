title: EuroPython 2022 Sprints
subtitle: Organize or join a sprint in Europython 2022!
---

Sprints will be run on the conference weekend: Saturday & Sunday Jul 16 & 17 on the conference venue. 

As is tradition, sprints are not organized by the conference organizers, but instead run by the participants who want to put on a sprint. We only provide the virtual rooms and guidance on how to run the sprints.


## What is a “Sprint” ?

Most open source software development happens on the internet and developers usually communicate online only when working on projects. This usually works out fine, but the lack of live meetings can sometimes be a limiting factor in making good progress.

For this reason, a form of impromptu coding meetups called “sprints” or “hackathons” (outside the Python community, the term “hackathon” is more common) were initiated, where developers interested in a project can get together for a short period of time to make quick progress. Since conferences provide the perfect occasion to meet, sprints are made part of the conference program.
