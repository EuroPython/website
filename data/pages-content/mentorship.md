# Speaker Mentorship Programme

As a diverse and inclusive community EuroPython offers support for potential speakers who want help preparing for their contribution. To achieve this, we are running the Speaker Mentorship Programme again.

We are looking for both mentors and mentees to be a part of the programme.

## 1. One-to-One Mentorship Programme

### Open between 22 February - 12 March 2023

A mentee needing help with their proposal will be matched with an experienced mentor. The mentor's job is to facilitate and support the mentee so they are able to contribute to EuroPython with confidence. The bulk of the mentorship will be before **19 March**, prior to the closing of [Call for Proposals (CFP)](/cfp). A mentor serves as the guide, supporter and source of help to the mentee; they are not expected to tell the mentee what their contribution should be (that's for the mentee to decide).

## Mentors

</div>


We expect mentors to have past speaking experience at conferences similar to EuroPython.

For mentors who take on a mentee, we expect you to provide 4 one-hour sessions with your mentee to:

- Prepare their CFP submission.
- Review their CFP before submission.
- If your mentee is selected, help them prepare the talk. Otherwise, help them submit their talk to another meetup/conference should they wish to.
- Help your mentee rehearse for their talk.


You will also be invited to join the panel of the Webinar Workshops.

If you require help contributing to EuroPython, especially if you are from an underrepresented or a marginalised group in the tech industry, you are welcome to submit your application above to become a mentee.

## 2. Workshops ##

### Ask Me Anything about CFP Workshop - Tuesday, 14 March 2023, 18:00 CET

We encourage anyone who has no or little experience submitting to EuroPython's CFP to join and ask questions. Questions can range from talk ideas, what makes a good proposal to what is the selection process of the talk.

A recording of the session will be made available after the event.


### First-Time Speaker Workshop - Date/Time TBA

In the workshop, we'll have experienced speakers from the EuroPython community to share their know-how on delivering an effective talk. We hope this will help you learn something meaningful about public speaking before your presentation at EuroPython 2023.

A recording of the session will be made available after the event.

## 3. Speaker Placement Programme

One of the support that we provide for mentees is to provide speaking opportunities for them to practise. We understand that not all of our mentees will be speaking at EuroPython and for new speakers, speaking at a conference as their first speaking experience can be a bit intimidating. For that, we would like to help mentees to speak at a local event or meetup before or after EuroPython.

If you are an event/ meetup organiser who is looking for speakers, please kindly fill in the form and we would be happy to introduce our mentees to you if there’s a match.
