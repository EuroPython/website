# Women in AI Workshop @ EuroPython

## Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

**Description**: Python is the most popular language for Machine Learning. Women in AI is delighted to bring a half-day workshop for introducing the intuition behind machine learning along with a series of hands-on sessions to implement machine learning models using Pandas and Scikit-Learn Python libraries. This workshop is designed to explain concepts in byte-sized contents and focus primarily on Python programming.

- **Who can join**: Anyone with a EuroPython 2023 [Conference Ticket or Combined Ticket](/tickets#ticket-types). Slots are available for 30 participants. We appreciate if you could register your interest in the form below to help us plan!
- **When**: 13:45â€“17:00, Monday 17 July
- **Where**: [Prague Congress Centre (PCC)](/where#prague-congress-centre---conference-venue)), Room TBC
- **What do you need to bring?**
A laptop with internet access. We will be working on Google Colab on your web browser, hence, no prior set-up will be required.
- **Level**: Beginner (Basic prior knowledge of Python is helpful but is not required for this workshop; No prior knowledge of Machine Learning is expected)
