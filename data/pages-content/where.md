## Prague
<img src="/img/Prague.jpeg"/>

<br></br>

Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic. Sitting on the [Vltava River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6kqu2mk-Kw), the beautiful historic centre is a UNESCO world heritage site. There's a LOT to see, do and enjoy, in addition to the conference! The ancient fortress [VyÅ¡ehrad](https://www.vysehradtickets.com/vysehrad/) is just 10-min walk away from the conference venue.

As per EuroPython tradition, we shall walk around, chat, laugh and explore the city together. Whether it is to enjoy the stunning view of the "[City of a Hundred Spires](https://www.prague.eu/en/articles/the-towers-of-prague-10537)" from any (or all!) of the 120+ towers, or standing still to admire the wonder of [Prague Astronomical Clock](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/3129/astronomical-clock?back=1). The only problem is being spoiled for choice!

In addition, Prague has an extensive and modern public transport system; its [public transport website](https://www.dpp.cz/en) will give you all the information you need.

Check out the following resources for some guides to the city:

EuroPython in 2023 between 17-21 July. [Located within walking distance](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Prague+Congress+Centre/@50.0710932,14.4348111,13.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4d26855708eb61f7!8m2!3d50.0625764!4d14.4290206?hl=en-GB)
of the historic city centre, the conference centre is adjacent to the VyÅ¡ehrad
station on Line C of the Prague underground railway network, providing convenient

It's an important venue, having hosted the IMF, NATO and other significant and
powerful international organisations. Now they can add EuroPython to that list! ðŸ˜›
