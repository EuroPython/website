## Prague
<img src="/img/Prague.jpeg"/>

<br></br>

Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic. Sitting on the [Vltava River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6kqu2mk-Kw), the beautiful historic centre is a UNESCO world heritage site. There's a LOT to see, do and enjoy, in addition to the conference! The ancient [Vyšehrad](https://www.vysehradtickets.com/vysehrad/) is just 10-min walk away from the conference venue. Not only is is an ancient fortress, but also a park with a great view of Prague Castle and the river. We hope you enjoy taking a walk with fellow Pythonistas in the tranquil park when you need a bit of peace from the buzz of the conference.  

As per EuroPython tradition, we shall walk around, chat, laugh and explore the city together. Whether it is to enjoy the stunning view of the "[City of a Hundred Spires](https://www.prague.eu/en/articles/the-towers-of-prague-10537)" from any (or all!) of the 120+ towers, or standing still to admire the wonder of [Prague Astronomical Clock](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/3129/astronomical-clock?back=1). The only problem is being spoiled for choice!

In addition, Prague has an extensive and modern public transport system; its [public transport website](https://www.dpp.cz/en) will give you all the information you need.

### Weather
 With an average July high of 25°C, remember to pack your shorts and sandals with your laptop, along with a spirit of adventure to explore one of the most visited and vibrant cities in Europe. Friendly reminder: it might get up to mid 30°C in July🥵 - we recommend packing sunscreen and regular hydration to avoid excessive burning.

## Prague Congress Centre - Conference Venue

[The Prague Congress Centre](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage) is the home of
EuroPython in 2023 between 17-21 July.

It's an important venue, having hosted the IMF, NATO and other significant and
powerful international organisations. Now they can add EuroPython to that list! 😛

The conference centre is adjacent to the Vyšehrad - a short walk away from [Náplavka](https://www.mmzoneblog.com/naplavka), full of cafes, pubs and restaurants, a wonderful area to relax by the river and take in the spirit of the city.

The Vyšehrad station next to the venue on Line C of the Prague underground railway network, also provides convenient
access by public transport from the city’s airport and all major rail and bus stations.

Vysoká škola ekonomická v Praze<br/>
nám. Winstona Churchilla 1938<br/>
130 00 Praha 3-Žižkov, Czechia<br/>
</address>

### Get to the Sprints
You can find the [Žižkov Campus Map, VŠE (PDF)](https://www.vse.cz/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/page/1000/planek_en.pdf) to help guide you. The entrance to the building can be recognized by the inscription "Vysoká škola ekonomická v Praze" above it.

How to get there?
* By bus: The nearest bus stop is Náměstí Winstona Churcilla (line 135) or Viktoria Žižkov (lines 101, 123, 135, 175, 176). If you disembark at Náměstí Winstona Churchilla, the entrance is directly across from the stop on Italská Street.
* By tram: Viktoria Žižkov station (lines 26, 5, 9) is a 5-10 minute walk. Proceed along Seifertová Street, pass through the park (Pomník Winstona Churchilla on Google Maps), then reach Italská Street. A short uphill walk of about one to two minutes, and the entrance will be on your left.
* By metro: Start from Hlavní Nádraží station (C line). After exiting the metro, ascend to the first floor (not the ground level) and turn left, following signs for the North platform (in Czech: Sever). Continue through the tunnel, ascend the escalators, and climb another set of stairs. You'll then find yourself on Italská Street, facing a large building - that's the VŠE building. Proceed uphill on Italská for a minute or two, and you'll see the entrance right there.
