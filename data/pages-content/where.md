# Where

EuroPython 2022 will be held in **Dublin**! The capital of the Republic of
Ireland, one of Europe’s biggest tech hubs, is a lively city with
extraordinarily rich and diverse food, culture, history and art lovers - the
number of museums and restaurants can certainly tickle most tastes.

As per EuroPython tradition, we shall walk around, chat, laugh and explore the
city together. If you are not the “walking-type”, let the convenient
[public transportation network](https://www.dublinpublictransport.ie/) work its
magic for you!

### The CCD Venue

[The Convention Centre Dublin (The CCD)](https://www.theccd.ie/) is the home of
EuroPython 2022. It is located at the heart of Dublin near the river, a stone’s
throw from the tech cluster in Silicon Docks, and a 10-minute walk from the city
centre.
