## Prague

<br></br>

Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic. Sitting on the [Vltava River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6kqu2mk-Kw), the beautiful historic centre is a UNESCO world heritage site. There's a LOT to see, do and enjoy, in addition to the conference! The ancient [Vy≈°ehrad](https://www.vysehradtickets.com/vysehrad/) is just 10-min walk away from the conference venue. Not only is is an ancient fortress, but also a park with a great view of Prague Castle and the river. We hope you enjoy taking a walk with fellow Pythonistas in the tranquil park when you need a bit of peace from the buzz of the conference.  

As per EuroPython tradition, we shall walk around, chat, laugh and explore the city together. Whether it is to enjoy the stunning view of the "[City of a Hundred Spires](https://www.prague.eu/en/articles/the-towers-of-prague-10537)" from any (or all!) of the 120+ towers, or standing still to admire the wonder of [Prague Astronomical Clock](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/3129/astronomical-clock?back=1). The only problem is being spoiled for choice!

In addition, Prague has an extensive and modern public transport system; its [public transport website](https://www.dpp.cz/en) will give you all the information you need.

## Prague Congress Centre - Conference Venue

[The Prague Congress Centre](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage) is the home of
EuroPython in 2023 between 17-21 July.

It's an important venue, having hosted the IMF, NATO and other significant and
powerful international organisations. Now they can add EuroPython to that list! üòõ

The conference centre is adjacent to the Vy≈°ehrad - a short walk away from [N√°plavka](https://www.mmzoneblog.com/naplavka), full of cafes, pubs and restaurants, a wonderful area to relax by the river and take in the spirit of the city.

The Vy≈°ehrad station next to the venue on Line C of the Prague underground railway network, also provides convenient
access by public transport from the city‚Äôs airport and all major rail and bus stations.

Vysok√° ≈°kola ekonomick√° v Praze<br/>
n√°m. Winstona Churchilla 1938<br/>
130 00 Praha 3-≈Ωi≈ækov, Czechia<br/>
</address>

### Get to the Sprints
You can find the [≈Ωi≈ækov Campus Map, V≈†E (PDF)](https://www.vse.cz/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/page/1000/planek_en.pdf) to help guide you. The entrance to the building can be recognized by the inscription "Vysok√° ≈°kola ekonomick√° v Praze" above it.

How to get there?
* By bus: The nearest bus stop is N√°mƒõst√≠ Winstona Churcilla (line 135) or Viktoria ≈Ωi≈ækov (lines 101, 123, 135, 175, 176). If you disembark at N√°mƒõst√≠ Winstona Churchilla, the entrance is directly across from the stop on Italsk√° Street.
* By tram: Viktoria ≈Ωi≈ækov station (lines 26, 5, 9) is a 5-10 minute walk. Proceed along Seifertov√° Street, pass through the park (Pomn√≠k Winstona Churchilla on Google Maps), then reach Italsk√° Street. A short uphill walk of about one to two minutes, and the entrance will be on your left.
* By metro: Start from Hlavn√≠ N√°dra≈æ√≠ station (C line). After exiting the metro, ascend to the first floor (not the ground level) and turn left, following signs for the North platform (in Czech: Sever). Continue through the tunnel, ascend the escalators, and climb another set of stairs. You'll then find yourself on Italsk√° Street, facing a large building - that's the V≈†E building. Proceed uphill on Italsk√° for a minute or two, and you'll see the entrance right there.
