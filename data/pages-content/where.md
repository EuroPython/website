# Where

EuroPython 2023 will be held in **Prague**! The capital of the Czech Repeblic
and sitting on the [Vltava river](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6kqu2mk-Kw), 
Prague is one of the top five city destinations in Europe. The beautiful historic 
centre is a UNESCO world heritage site. So, in addition to the conference, 
there's a LOT to see, do and enjoy. Prague has an extensive and modern public 
transport system, so travelling around won't be a problem and getting there is 
easy via well serviced train, air and road infrastructure. With an average 
July high of 25°c, remember to pack your shorts and sandals with your laptop, 
along with a spirit of adventure to explore one of the most visited and vibrant 
cities in Europe.

As per EuroPython tradition, we shall walk around, chat, laugh and explore the
city together. If you are not the “walking-type”, 
[Prague's public transport website](https://prague.org/public-transportation-in-prague/)
will give you all the information you need.
