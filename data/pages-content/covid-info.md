# Covid Information

Hey Pythonistas! If youâ€™re interested in attending EuroPython 2022 in Dublin,
Ireland, we have prepared some information about COVID-19 related health
measures.

_NOTE:_ Given the constantly changing situation of COVID-19, the information can
change at any time and without warning; so could the capacity and restrictions
at the venue. The organisers will try to provide up to date information on this
page, but it is always better to refer to the
[official guidelines from the Irish Government](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/77952-government-advice-on-international-travel/).
For any major changes, we will post the updates on our news channels. Stay
Tuned!

## Travelling to Ireland

From Sunday 6 March 2022, people arriving in Ireland are no longer required to
show proof of vaccination, proof of recovery or a negative PCR test result upon
arrival. There are no post-arrival testing or quarantine requirements for
travellers to Ireland. Any individual that develops COVID-19 symptoms while in
Ireland should follow the HSE guidance in relation to
[isolation](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/restricted-movements/) and
undertaking
[antigen or PCR testing](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/testing/) as
appropriate.

## The Venue rules

For conferences, the majority of COVID-19 restrictions at the venue have been
lifted:

- no mandatory mask for attendees;
- no additional check of vaccination status;
- no restrictions for lunches and/or coffee breaks;
- no social distancing needed when queuing or for any seating arrangements;
- no capacity limit.

## Recommendations

Though most restrictions have been lifted, and you are not required to wear a
mask or keep social distance during the conference at the venue, please be
mindful of people who want to do so. Risk is perceived differently by people and
you should respect their choice.

We strongly encourage you to take all the health precautionary measures you can
to protect yourself and those around us. Thanks!
