## **Q. What will the schedule look like?**

A. The conference will be organised in three phases:

1. Monday & Tuesday (11.07 & 12.07): workshops and tutorials
2. Wednesday - Friday (13.07 - 15.07): main conference days
3. Saturday & Sunday (16.07 & 17.07): sprints (hackathon)

## **Q. What will the programme look like?**

A. To get an idea of what to expect, please have a look at the
[EP2021 programme](https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/sessions/) and the
[EP2019 programme](https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/sessions/).

The conference will feature around 20 tutorials/workshops, 120 talk sessions and other interactive sessions such as Posters, Helpdesks, Panel Discussions and a Maker Space.

We aim to have a very diverse programme, covering the many different aspects of where and how Python solves problems or engages in interesting things.

## **Q. When do you accept talk proposals?**

A. The [Call for Proposals](/cfp) (CFP) has closed. It ran between the 8 March - 3 April.

We are thrilled to have received a record high of 429 proposals on a diverse range of topics.

## **Q. How do you review and select talks?**

A. We believe that a good conference consists of popular talks as well as new or niche topics - all by and for our diverse community. Thus, after Call for Proposals (CFP) finishes, submissions go through two rounds of review and refinement as we put together our programme. This is a "blind" process, so speakers' names will not be displayed to the reviewers.

- community voting: open to all 2015-2022 EuroPython conference ticket holders + 2022 talk proposal submitters. Submissions are in random order for each voter. Please check out our [talk voting page](/voting) for details.

- panel feedback: a diverse group of experienced reviewers will refine and give feedback on the submissions within their realm of expertise. Their insights help the programme team refine and plan a programme that truly reflects, informs and stimulates our EuroPython family. [Submit your interest here](https://t.co/JyOdGb71f8)

Ultimately, the programme team curate the final programme based upon these important factors: community voting, panel feedback and editorial criteria such as the diversity, depth and breadth of topics and speakers.

## **Q. What support do you give to speakers?**
A. If accepted, speakers are eligible for a free conference ticket. Workshop & tutorial organisers are eligible for a free combined ticket. In addition, speakers are encouraged to apply for additional [Financial Aid](/finaid), should there be a need.

We give support to first-time speakers and actively encourage, accommodate and welcome the participation of those from under-represented groups in tech. For example, our [Speaker Mentorship Programme](/mentorship) matched 15 mentees with mentors. Check out the [AMA session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18donGcl0Jg) as part of the Mentorship Programme.

Email us at ([program@europython.eu](mailto:program@europython.eu) to tell us what other broader speaker support you might need!

## **Q. When will ticket sales start?**

## **Q. How soon should I book accommodation and flights?**
