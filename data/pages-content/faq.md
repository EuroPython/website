## **Q. When and where is EuroPython 2023 taking place?**

A. EuroPython 2023 will be held on
**17-23 July 2023**. Put the dates in your diary!

The in-person conference will be held at <b>[The Prague Congress Centre, the PCC](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage)</b> in Prague, Czech Republic.

For the virtual conference, detailed instructions will be announced at a later time.

We are planning on something a bit different for the sprints weekend. Stay tuned for more details!

If you have any questions, you are welcome to reach out to the team at [helpdesk@europython.eu](helpdesk@europython.eu).

## **Q. What will the schedule look like?**

A. The conference will be organised in three phases:

1. Monday & Tuesday (17.07 & 18.07): workshops and tutorials
2. Wednesday - Friday (19.07 - 21.07): main conference days
3. Saturday & Sunday (22.07 & 23.07): sprints (hackathon), location and details TBC.

## **Q. What will the programme look like?**

A. The conference will feature around 20 hands-on tutorials & workshops, 120 talks and other interactive sessions. We aim to have a very diverse programme, covering the many different aspects of where and how Python solves problems or engages in interesting things.

To get an idea of what to expect, have a look at the [EP2022's programme.](https://ep2022.europython.eu/schedule/)

To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated based on the input from the community voting.

We are always keen to hear new ideas on how to enrich the programme and other activities you are interested in participating during the conference. Share your thoughts with the programme team at [programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).


## **Q. When do you accept talk proposals?**

A. The Call for Proposals (CFP) will run for two weeks between **6-19 March 2023**. We are thrilled to receive proposals on any topic that could be of interest to our community.

Especially if you are considering becoming a **speaker for the first time**, or if you are from an underrepresented group, we strongly encourage you to send in your proposals. Our [Speaker Mentorship Programme](/mentorship) is open for applications between 22 February - 12 March. We will also have other broader support options.

If you have something in mind, there is no better time to start preparing your proposal! Please have a look at our [CFP page](/cfp) for details and we look forward to your proposals!

If you have questions or ideas you would like to share with our team, you are most welcome to reach out to our programme team at [programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).


## **Q. When do ticket sales start and what are the ticket prices like?**

A. Ticket sales are expected to start on **Tuesday 21 March.**

We have put a lot of work in keeping the in-person ticket prices affordable. Check out our [tickets page](/tickets) for details.

We encourage and trust you to pick a fair ticket tier that fits your personal circumstance. The money you spend will be put straight back to the community to support our diversity initiatives, Financial Aid Programme and other grants offered to the European Python community.

## **Q. Is there a Financial Aid Programme for EuroPython 2023?**
A. Yes, our [Financial Aid Programme](/finaid) for in-person participation is open for application until 21 May. If you need help to attend the conference, you are most welcome to apply.

## **Q. When can sponsors start signing up?**

A: The 2023 packages are not finalised yet, but will be similar to what we had in [EuroPython 2022](https://ep2022.europython.eu/sponsor). So do take a look to get an idea of the sponsorship options. We will publish our 2023 offerings soon on our [Sponsor Page](/sponsor).

**Sponsors who sign up early will again receive a 10% discount.**

We are committed to making EuroPython sponsorship accessible to most organisations keen to help the community. If you are interested in supporting EuroPython 2023, get in touch with our sponsors team at [sponsoring@europython.eu](sponsoring@europython.eu)

## **Q. How can I help you with the conference organisation?**

A. The EuroPython conference is entirely run by volunteers and we always need some extra help. If you want to get involved, please email [volunteers@europython.eu](volunteers@europython.eu) and we are always happy for a chat!
