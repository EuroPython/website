## **Q. What will the programme look like?**

A. The conference will feature around 20 hands-on tutorials & workshops, 120 talks and other interactive sessions. We aim to have a very diverse programme, covering the many different aspects of where and how Python solves problems or engages in interesting things.

To get an idea of what to expect, have a look at the [EP2023's programme.](https://ep2023.europython.eu/schedule/)

To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated based on the input from the community voting.

We are always keen to hear new ideas on how to enrich the programme and other activities you are interested in participating during the conference. Share your thoughts with the programme team at [programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).
