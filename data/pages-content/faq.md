## **Q. When and where is EuroPython 2023 taking place?**

A. EuroPython 2023 will be held on
**17-23 July 2023**. Put the dates in your diary!

The in-person conference will be held at <b>[The Prague Congress Centre, the PCC](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage)</b> in Prague, Czech Republic.

For the virtual conference, detailed instructions will be announced at a later time.

We are planning on something a bit different for the sprints weekend. Stay tuned for more details!

If you have any questions, you are welcome to reach out to the team at [helpdesk@europython.eu](helpdesk@europython.eu).

## **Q. What will the schedule look like?**

A. The conference will be organised in three phases:

1. Monday & Tuesday (17.07 & 18.07): workshops and tutorials
2. Wednesday - Friday (19.07 - 21.07): main conference days
3. Saturday & Sunday (22.07 & 23.07): sprints (hackathon), location and details TBC.

## **Q. What will the programme look like?**

A. The conference will feature around 20 hands-on tutorials & workshops, 120 talks and other interactive sessions. We aim to have a very diverse programme, covering the many different aspects of where and how Python solves problems or engages in interesting things.

To get an idea of what to expect, have a look at the [EP2022's programme.](https://ep2022.europython.eu/schedule/)

To select talks, we ran a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated based on the input from the community voting.

We are always keen to hear new ideas on how to enrich the programme and other activities you are interested in participating during the conference. Share your thoughts with the programme team at [programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).


## **Q. When do you accept talk proposals?**

A. The Call for Proposals (CFP) was run between **6-26 March 2023**. We are thrilled to have received more than 500 proposals on a wide range of topics. This record-breaking number of proposals reflected the great width of interests of our community. We are also proud to have provided support to first-time speakers via our [Speaker Mentorship Programme](/mentorship).

## **Q. How do you review and select talks?**

A. After Call for Proposals (CFP) finishes, submissions go through two rounds of review and refinement as we put together our programme. You can find the details about our selection process [here](/cfp#selection-process)

## **Q. What support do you give to speakers?**
A. Accepted speakers are eligible for a free Conference Ticket; accepted workshop & tutorial organisers are eligible for a free Combined Ticket (see details of the [ticket types](/tickets#ticket-types)). In addition, speakers are encouraged to apply for additional [Financial Aid](/finaid), should there be a need.
