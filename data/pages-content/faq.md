## **Q. What will the schedule look like?**

A. The conference will be organised in three phases:

1. Monday & Tuesday (11.07 & 12.07): workshops and tutorials
2. Wednesday - Friday (13.07 - 15.07): main conference days
3. Saturday & Sunday (16.07 & 17.07): sprints (hackathon)

## **Q. What will the programme look like?**

A. Take a look at our accepted sessions:
[EP2022 programme](/sessions)

The conference will feature around 20 tutorials/workshops/special events, 120 talk sessions and other interactive sessions such as Posters, Helpdesks, Panel Discussions and a MakerFest.

We aim to have a very diverse programme, covering the many different aspects of where and how Python solves problems or engages in interesting things.

## **Q. When do you accept talk proposals?**

A. The [Call for Proposals](/cfp) (CFP) has closed. It ran between the 8 March - 3 April.

We are thrilled to have received a record high of 429 proposals on a diverse range of topics.

## **Q. How do you review and select talks?**

A. We believe that a good conference consists of popular talks as well as new or niche topics - all by and for our diverse community. Thus, after Call for Proposals (CFP) finishes, submissions go through two rounds of review and refinement as we put together our programme. This is a "blind" process, so speakers' names will not be displayed to the reviewers.

- community voting: open to all 2015-2022 EuroPython conference ticket holders + 2022 talk proposal submitters. Submissions are in random order for each voter. Please check out our [talk voting page](/voting) for details.

- panel feedback: a diverse group of experienced reviewers will refine and give feedback on the submissions within their realm of expertise. Their insights help the programme team refine and plan a programme that truly reflects, informs and stimulates our EuroPython family. [Submit your interest here](https://t.co/JyOdGb71f8)

Ultimately, the programme team curate the final programme based upon these important factors: community voting, panel feedback and editorial criteria such as the diversity, depth and breadth of topics and speakers.

## **Q. What support do you give to speakers?**
A. If accepted, speakers are eligible for a free conference ticket. Workshop & tutorial organisers are eligible for a free combined ticket. In addition, speakers are encouraged to apply for additional [Financial Aid](/finaid), should there be a need.

We give support to first-time speakers and actively encourage, accommodate and welcome the participation of those from under-represented groups in tech. For example, our [Speaker Mentorship Programme](/mentorship) matched 15 mentees with mentors. Check out the [AMA session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18donGcl0Jg) as part of the Mentorship Programme.

Email us at ([program@europython.eu](mailto:program@europython.eu) to tell us what other broader speaker support you might need!

## **Q. When will ticket sales start?**

A. Early Bird ticket sales started on 17 March! Regular tickets are also available alongside early birds tickets.

We offer flexibility for the tickets, depending on what you would like to attend. For the in-person conference, there will be:

- Combined ticket: access to the whole conference
- Tutorials only ticket: access to only workshops/tutorials
- Conference only ticket : you can attend the conference days

Please check out our [Tickets page](/tickets) for more details.

Instead, if you decide to attend the conference remotely, also have remote tickets available for you to attend all talks, panels and keynotes during the conference days.

## **Q. What are the ticket prices like?**

A. We have put a lot of work in keeping the in-person ticket prices at a similar level to the last in-person conference in 2019, despite cost increases and the consequences of the pandemic.

Please check out our [Tickets page](/tickets) for more details.

We encourage and trust you to pick a fair ticket tier that fits your personal circumstance. The money you spend will be put straight back to the community to support our diversity initiatives, Financial Aid Programme and other grants offered to the European Python community. If you need help to attend the conference, you are most welcome to apply for [Financial Aid](/finaid)

## **Q. Can I attend EuroPython remotely?**

A. Yes, remote tickets are on sale from **7th June 2022** onward. It is now possible to purchase a conference ticket (personal/ business) to participate in the conference from anywhere on the planet.

Please check out our [Tickets page](/tickets) for more details.

## **Q. What access does a remote ticket give me?**

A. We strive make remote participation as interactive as possible! During the Conference Days (Wednesday-Friday), not only can you watch the live talks, keynotes & panels in all 6 tracks, you can also participate in lightning talks, ask questions directly to a speaker (with voice and video), and chat with available speakers in breakout discussions. Participation during sprint days is to be determined.

## **Q. How can I join after having bought a remote ticket?**

A. We will have a dedicated platform for you to join remotely. We will email the the joining instructions a few days before the conference.

## **Q. What is the difference between a remote ticket and livestream-only ticket**

A. As per our tradition, we provide open and free access to the livestreams of our conference talks (13-15 July). You are not required to register a ticket, but you are welcome to if you would like an email reminder or receive up-to-date information about the conference.

But The free livestream-only ticket does not include support and you will be unable to interact with the speakers or other in-person audience. Consider getting a remote ticket instead.

## **Q. Will the conference talks and tutorials be recorded?**

A. Recordings of the talks will be made available on our YouTube channel a few months after the conference. Tutorials will only be delivered in-person and will not be recorded.

## **Q. Is there a Financial Aid Program for EP2022?**
A. Yes, our
[Financial Aid programme](/finaid) for in-person participation was open for submissions between 8 March - 23 May. It is now closed.

Financial Aid for Remote Tickets is open on 7 June, together with [remote ticket sales](/tickets#remote-tickets). If you need support to attend the conference remotely, make sure to [apply](/finaid#financial-aid) by 3 July 2022.

## **Q. Do you provide childcare at the venue?**
A. Yes. Children are welcome and we provide free childcare service at the venue staffed by qualified childminders. If you are attending with your children, please register a ticket for yourself and select how many children will require childcare at checkout. Space is limited, so do register your request early.

## **Q. Do you provide food at the venue?**
A. Yes. Each ticket includes break refreshments and a light lunch for each day.


## **Q. How soon should I book accommodation and flights?**

A. The time and location of the conference have been set, so you can book at any time. We would recommend you consider flexible bookings in case of any changes of plans in the future as well as appropriate insurance cover.
