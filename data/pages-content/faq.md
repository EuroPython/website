## **Q. When and where is EuroPython 2023 taking place?**

A. EuroPython 2023 will be held on
**17-23 July 2023**. Put the dates in your diary!

The in-person conference will be held at <b>[The Prague Congress Centre, the PCC](https://www.praguecc.cz/en/homepage)</b> in Prague, Czech Republic.

For the virtual conference, detailed instructions will be announced at a later time.

We are planning on something a bit different for the sprints weekend. Stay tuned for more details!

If you have any questions, you are welcome to reach out to the team at [helpdesk@europython.eu](helpdesk@europython.eu).

## **Q. How soon should I book accommodation and flights?**
A. Currently, the EuroPython Society board are still finalising the contract with the venue. Though we hope for no surprises, we would recommend you consider flexible bookings in case of any changes of plans in the future as well as appropriate insurance cover. We will inform the community soon as we've signed the final dotted line.

## **Q. What will the schedule look like?**

A. The conference will be organised in three phases:

1. Monday & Tuesday (17.07 & 18.07): workshops and tutorials
2. Wednesday - Friday (19.07 - 21.07): main conference days
3. Saturday & Sunday (22.07 & 23.07): sprints (hackathon), location and details TBC.

## **Q. What will the programme look like?**

A. The conference will feature around 20 hands-on tutorials & workshops, 120 talks and other interactive sessions. We aim to have a very diverse programme, covering the many different aspects of where and how Python solves problems or engages in interesting things.

To get an idea of what to expect, have a look at the [EP2022's programme.](https://ep2022.europython.eu/schedule/)

To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated based on the input from the community voting. Make sure to subscribe to our [EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) for updates.

We are always keen to hear new ideas on how to enrich the programme and other activities you are interested in participating during the conference. Share your thoughts with the programme team at [programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).


## **Q. When do you accept talk proposals?**

A. The Call for Proposals (CFP) will run for two weeks between **6-19 March 2023**. We are thrilled to receive proposals on any topic that could be of interest to our community.

Especially if you are considering becoming a speaker for the first time, or if you are from an underrepresented group, we strongly encourage you to send in your proposals. A speaker mentorship programme will open for applications on 22 Feburary. We will also have other broader support options. Make sure to subscribe to our [EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) for updates.

If you have something in mind, there is no better time to start preparing your  proposal! For more insights, please have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ep2022.europython.eu/cfp">EuroPython 2022 CFP page</a>. Some details may change for 2023, but overall, the structure is going to be similar.

If you have questions or ideas you would like to share with our team, you are most welcome to reach out to our programme team at [programme@europython.eu](mailto:programme@europython.eu).

## **Q. When do ticket sales start?**

A. Ticket sales will start in March. Make sure to subscribe to our [EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) where the opening dates will be announced.

## **Q. What are the ticket prices like?**

A. We are aiming to keep the ticket prices similar to our [conference in 2022](https://ep2022.europython.eu/tickets#ticket-prices), though an increase might be necessary due to cost increases.

As usual, there will be several ticket options, so you can choose the one most suitable for you. Details will be announced around the end of February on our website and [EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup).

## **Q. Is there a Financial Aid Programme for EuroPython 2023?**
A. Yes, we will have a Financial Aid programme this year similar to the one we had in [2022](https://ep2022.europython.eu/finaid). Please watch out for announcements on the [EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup).

## **Q. When can sponsors start signing up?**

A: The 2023 packages are not finalised yet, but will be similar to what we had in [EuroPython 2022](https://ep2022.europython.eu/sponsor). So do take a look to get an idea of the sponsorship options. **Sponsors who sign up early will again receive a 10% discount.**

We are committed to making EuroPython sponsorship accessible to most organisations keen to help the community. If you are interested in supporting EuroPython 2023, get in touch with our sponsors team at [sponsoring@europython.eu](sponsoring@europython.eu)

## **Q. How can I help you with the conference organisation?**
