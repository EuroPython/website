üêç Pythonistas, mark the dates:

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
**EuroPython 2023 Call for Proposals (CFP) will be open** between

 **Monday, 6 March 2023** and

 **Sunday, 19 March 2023** [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)
</div>



We invite proposals from the whole community on a wide range of topics. We welcome speakers at all python levels with any experience with public speaking.

You are welcome to share your questions and ideas with our programme team at [programme@europython.eu](programme@europython.eu)

## The Conference Format ##

The conference will feature around 16 Tutorials/Workshops and 120 talk sessions:

* **Tutorials/Workshops (17-18 July)**: hands-on **180-mins sessions**

* **Talks (19-21 July)** : **30, 45, or 60-minute** presentations of Python general topics & PyData related topics

All presentation content can be at **beginner, intermediate or advanced** level.

Other than talks and tutorials, you are also welcome to submit **posters** - printed in large formats. It is a graphical way to showcase your research, project or technology. Posters are exhibited at the conference, read at any time by participants, and can be discussed face-to-face with their authors during the poster session.


## Topics ##

We welcome presentations focusing on a variety of topics all around Python, e.g. programming, engineering, cloud, DevOps, web, Django, hardware, community, education, or whatever you deem suitable - **it is your conference!**

To see the type of topics presented at previous EuroPython events, check out our [past EuroPython conferences](https://www.europython-society.org/europython/).

For PyData related ideas, take a look at PyData events: [pydata.org](https://pydata.org/).

### Open Source ###
As a reminder, EuroPython presentations are intended to share knowledge and experience. To this end, we encourage the code and/or data that your talk relies on to be open-source. Ideally, the audience would have access to the necessary tools to reproduce the results of the talk. We welcome talks focused on the practical application of tools and concepts you use; but we discourage sales-oriented proposals whose main aim is to sell a product.

## Selection Process ##

We believe that a good conference consists of popular talks as well as new or niche topics - all by and for our diverse community. Thus, after Call for Proposals (CFP) finishes, submissions go through two rounds of review and refinement as we put together our programme. This is a "blind" process, so speakers' names will not be displayed to the reviewers.

* **community voting**: open to all 2015-2023 EuroPython conference ticket holders + 2023 proposal submitters. Submissions are in random order for each voter. Stay tuned for more details!

* **panel feedback**: a diverse group of experienced reviewers will refine and give feedback on the submissions within their realm of expertise. Their insights help the programme team refine and plan a programme that truly reflects, informs and stimulates our EuroPython family. Submit your interest here

Ultimately, the programme team curate the final programme based upon these important factors: community voting, panel feedback and editorial criteria such as the diversity, depth and breadth of topics and speakers.

## First-Time Speakers ##

We encourage submissions by first-time speakers, especially those from under-represented backgrounds. Towards the goal, we will run a **Speaker Mentorship Programme** and match mentees with experienced mentors. who can offer advice and feedback on talk ideas/presentations. The Mentorship Programme will run two workshops: one close to the CFP closing date, focusing on improving your submissions; the other close to the conference date, helping you improve your talk.

Mentorship Programme sign-up starts on 22 February. More details will be announced soon!

[comment]: # (We are hoping to meet as many speakers as possible in-person. To make travel easier, **accepted speakers are eligible for a free ticket to attend the conference**. Travel and accommodation expenses will not be reimbursed; but we will have a Financial Aid programme and encourage speakers, especially those from under-represented backgrounds to apply.)
