</div>


EuroPython reflects the colourful and diverse backgrounds, cultures and interests of our community, so you (yes, you!) should go for it: **propose something and represent!**

No matter your level of Python or public speaking experience, EuroPython's job is to help you bring yourself to our community so we all flourish and benefit from each other's experience and contribution.

If you’re thinking, “but they don’t mean me”, then we especially mean **YOU**.

* If you’re from a background that isn't usually well-represented in most Python groups, get involved - we want to help you make a difference.

* If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most Python groups, get involved - we want your help making a difference.

* If you’re worried about not being technical enough, get involved - your fresh perspective will be invaluable.

* If you think you’re an imposter, join us - many of the EuroPython organisers feel this way.

* This is a volunteer led community, so join us - you will be welcomed with friendship, support and compassion.


You are welcome to share your questions and ideas with our programme team at [programme@europython.eu](programme@europython.eu).

## The Conference Format ##

The conference will feature around 16 Tutorials/Workshops and 120 talk sessions:

* **Tutorials/Workshops (17-18 July)**: hands-on **180-mins sessions**

* **Talks (19-21 July)** : **30, 45, or 60-minute** : presentations of specific and general interest to the European Python community (including a dedicated PyData track)

You are also welcome to submit **posters** - printed in large formats. It is a graphical way to showcase your research, project or technology. Posters are exhibited at the conference, read at any time by participants, and can be discussed face-to-face with their authors during the poster sessions between 19-21 July.


All Presentations will be designated the following levels:

* **Beginner** - where the audience requires little or no previous knowledge to engage with the subject matter.

* **Intermediate** - some knowledge is assumed, although aspects of the talk may introduce new (more advanced) topics.

* **Advanced** - the audience is full of subject matter experts... go ahead and really geek out.

## Topics ##

We welcome presentations on any topic that will be of specific or general interest to members of the Python community. We are a broad and deep community, so talks that may, at first, seem niche or unexpected actually make EuroPython the cosmopolitan place that it is. **It's your conference!**

Browse through our [past conferences](https://www.europython-society.org/europython/) and [talk videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/EuroPythonConference) for more ideas and to learn where there may be gaps that ought to be filled.

For ideas to contribute to the PyData track, take a look at PyData events: [pydata.org](https://pydata.org/).

## Selection Process ##

To ensure our programme reflects our diverse community, submissions go through three rounds of review and refinement before the final programme is announced:

* **Community voting**  - is open to all 2015-2023 EuroPython conference ticket holders, and anyone who proposes a talk for the 2023 conference. This helps us judge both the uniqueness, niche-ness, popularity and interestingness of each proposal.

* **Panel feedback** - a diverse group of experienced reviewers refine and provide constructive feedback on submissions within their realm of expertise. This helps us to judge the balance, quality and diversity of our programme.

* **Programme team** - appointed by the EuroPython Society, these volunteers curate the final programme based upon the results of community voting and panel feedback. They also ensure we meet editorial criteria such as diversity, depth and breadth of topics and speakers.


## First-Time Speakers ##

As in previous years, there will be a **Speaker Mentorship Programme** for anyone who needs help preparing their contribution. We especially focus on those for whom it might be their first time contributing to our conference, especially those from under-represented backgrounds. To this end we will match mentees with experienced and supportive mentors and run two workshops online: one close to the CFP closing date, focusing on improving your submissions; the other close to the conference date, helping you improve your talk.

Mentorship Programme sign-up starts on **22 February**. More details will be announced soon!

[comment]: # (We are hoping to meet as many speakers as possible in-person. To make travel easier, **accepted speakers are eligible for a free ticket to attend the conference**. Travel and accommodation expenses will not be reimbursed; but we will have a Financial Aid programme and encourage speakers, especially those from under-represented backgrounds to apply.)

## Open Source ##

EuroPython's aim is to share knowledge, skills and experience for the benefit of all in our open source community. To this end, we encourage your contribution to be released under an open source licence, and for the tools and code needed to engage with your talk to be freely available under an open source license. Sales-oriented proposals whose main aim is to sell a product are discouraged at EuroPython.
