  <summary><h4 id="optiover3-production-engineer">Production Engineer</h4></summary>

  <h5>WHAT YOU'LL DO:</h5>
  As a Production Engineer, you'll be responsible for deploying, maintaining, monitoring and improving the reliability, scalability and performance of our in-house built trading systems. At Optiver, reliability means prevention and swift resolution across our software, to guarantee optimum functioning even in the most extreme market conditions. Having a decisive nature, engineering mindset and preference for simple solutions are essential to keeping our systems reliable.

  The Production Engineer role is crucial for Optiver's trading activities. Your scope will cover market access, monitoring and compliance, strategy evaluation and management, performance tuning and trading automation. Sitting in the middle of our buzzing trading floor, you will have constant face-to-face interaction with end-users (Traders and Researchers as well as fellow Engineers). This is an engineering role, not a support role, so you'll set the standards for our production environment. As part of our core business, you will make a real, direct impact on our ability to trade and trading results. No two days are the same in our high-stakes, flat-hierarchy environment.
