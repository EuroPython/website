  What you will do in this role 🧐

  As a DevOps engineer you will be working on the Sendcloud platform within the platform domain. Your work will be distributed between the requirements set by the development team, while still being able to contribute to the overall platform improvements. That platform is used by our software development teams to build, test, deploy and run software themselves. You will be responsible for onboarding development teams into the world of DevOps, and guide developers on the importance of inclusion of non-functional requirements (observability, operations, deployments, security, etc.), with how to define their CI/CD pipelines, and assist them with software development tooling.

  As a part of the DevOps team your goal is to make the product development teams fully independent and more productive with a self-service, scalable platform and related software development tooling. You will co-work with the software engineers from development teams, making sure they know how to use the platform, automate repeating tasks, and taking their feedback into account for further improvements.

  - You have at least 3 years of experience in a similar DevOps role.
