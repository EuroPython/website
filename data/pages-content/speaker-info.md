# Speaker Information | Talks, Training Sessions, Posters

### Q. How can I add another speaker to my proposal?

You may add additional speakers to your proposal only while the CfP is still open. Speakers may not be changed after the closing of the CfP.
 
### Q. Can I rely on Internet during my talk?

The conference venue's wifi should be able to handle the large number of devices we expect at the conference. However, as experience shows, relying on Internet during talks is a risky game, so we advise to have a backup plan available to be able to give the talk without Internet connection.

We will try to have cabled Internet available at speaker desks, but cannot promise anything at this time.

### Q. Do I need video adapters for my talk?

We will have HDMI to VGA and mini-DisplayPort to VGA adapters available in each room, but it's always a good idea to bring your own.

If you are speaking, please test your notebook and adapter with the projector in the room where your talk is scheduled on the day before you give your talk. For speakers giving their talk on Monday, please test your notebooks in one of the breaks before the talks.

Please also check our tips for speakers below.

### Q. Do I have to print my poster?

Yes. We are not offering poster printing service, only the panels to attach them to.

### Q. What size should be the posters?

Posters should be **portrait** DIN A0 sized: 84.1cm wide Ã— 118.9cm high.

### Q. Where will be the poster session?

The area for the poster session will be in the Forum, the poster presentation will overlap with lunch so more attendees have a chance to interact.

There won't be tables in front of each poster.

### Q. I have submitted a talk, but would like to make some edits. How does that work?

Please log in to pretalx via (https://program.europython.eu) using the email address you submitted your proposal with and select the talk title that you want to edit. Edit the abstract/ description and then click on the save button.

### Q. I am a Speaker at EuroPython, will I receive a Speaker ticket?

Yes, we will be releasing Speakers in the 4th week of June. You'll receive an email from our program team program@europython.eu

For those of you who have purchased tickets before the schedule is announced and thus cannot use the speaker coupons, we will be refunding them upon request.

In order for us to issue the refunds, please provide us with your details by sending us an email at  refunds@europython.eu 

You can also donate your already purchased ticket to our Financial Aid programme those will be put to good use and automatically go into the financial aid budget for the conference.

### Q. What is a Lightning Talk? and when will they be scheduled?

A lightning talk (LT) is a short presentation which must not be longer than five minute.
To sign up for a lightning talk, please put your name and topic on the whiteboard close to the registration desk.
Signing up is on a first-come-first-served basis. The queue is reset every day in the morning.
You may talk about / present (almost) everything with certain boundaries:

1. no promotion for products of companies, no call for 'we are hiring' (but you may name your employer).
2. conference announcements are limited to one minute only
3. one LT per person per conference policy
4. keep it short, the shorter the presentations, the more people can give a talk
