# Talks, Training Sessions, Posters

How can I add another speaker to my proposal?
You may add additional speakers to your proposal only while the CfP is still open. Speakers may not be changed after the closing of the CfP.

Currently you can not do this by yourself, and we have to fix this via the backend:
While the CfP is still open, please contact program@europython.eu to discuss your options.
 
Can I rely on Internet during my talk?
The conference venue's wifi should be able to handle the large number of devices we expect at the conference. However, as experience shows, relying on Internet during talks is a risky game, so we advise to have a backup plan available to be able to give the talk without Internet connection.

We will try to have cabled Internet available at speaker desks, but cannot promise anything at this time.

Do I need video adapters for my talk?
We will have HDMI to VGA and mini-DisplayPort to VGA adapters available in each room, but it's always a good idea to bring your own.

If you are speaking, please test your notebook and adapter with the projector in the room where your talk is scheduled on the day before you give your talk. For speakers giving their talk on Monday, please test your notebooks in one of the breaks before the talks.

Please also check our tips for speakers page.

Do I have to print my poster?
Yes. We are not offering poster printing service, only the panels to attach them to.

What size should be the posters?
Posters should be portrait DIN A0 sized: 84.1cm wide × 118.9cm high.

Where will be the poster session?
The area for the poster session will be in the exhibition hall, so there will be more people around doing other things.

There won't be tables in front of each poster.

I have submitted a talk, but would like to make some edits. How does that work?
Please log in to the website and navigate to your user panel  (click ‘My account’ in top right). At the bottom of the page you should see a list of talks you have submitted. Clicking on each of these links will take you to the appropriate talk page where you can edit the talk description.

Will I get a discount if I get selected as speaker?
Yes, we will make the following refunds available for speakers:

Talk, poster, panel organizer, interactive session organizer: 25% refund on your ticket

Training: 100% refund on your ticket

We will send out coupons to all speakers of accepted talks and other session types.

For those of you who have purchased tickets before the schedule is announced and thus cannot use the coupons, we will be refunding the corresponding amount after the conference upon request.

In order for us to issue the refunds, please provide us with your details by sending us an email at  refunds@europython.eu or come to the conference desk to have the details stored in our spreadsheet.

Refund coupons which are not used and speaker refunds for already bought tickets which are not requested until one week after the conference (July 21), will be put to good use and automatically go into the financial aid budget for next year's conference.

Must I sign the video recording and publishing agreement?
To simplify the organization, we ask all speakers and trainers to accept the video recording and publishing of their session. We are aiming to have all talks and similar sessions recorded. Training will not be recorded.

Lightning Talks
A lightning talk (LT) is a short presentation which must not be longer than five minute.
To sign up for a lightning talk, please put your name and topic on the whiteboard close to the registration desk.
Signing up is on a first-come-first-served basis. The queue is reset every day in the morning.
You may talk about / present (almost) everything with certain boundaries:

no promotion for products of companies, no call for 'we are hiring' (but you may name your employer).
conference announcements are limited to one minute only
one LT per person per conference policy: everyone who has not given a LT at this year's conference, yet, is ahead of you in the queue
keep it short, the shorter the presentations, the more people can give a talk
