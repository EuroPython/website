subtitle: Help us to have a great conference!

EuroPython is organized and run by volunteers from the Python community, but we're only a few and need your help to make the show run as smoothly as possible, so we'd appreciate more help from the EuroPython attendees, if possible.

This page explains some of the tasks we have available for you.

Being a volunteer means to give your time for free, without expecting anything back, just for the pleasure of being a part of this amazing conference.

In return, we will have a small number of perks for you, some small gifts to say "thank you" for your time and for your help.


# Things to remember
  - To enter the conference you need a ticket
  - Yo can sign up to any tasks on our Volunteer App before you have bought a ticket
  - You will not earn a ticket for being a volunteer
