# Visa Information

## Requirements
If you want to attend EuroPython 2023 in Prague, the Czech Republic, you should first verify whether you need a visa to enter the Czech Republic, and apply for one if you do.

[This list of countries](https://www.mzv.cz/jnp/en/information_for_aliens/short_stay_visa/list_of_states_whose_citizens_are/index.html) defines if you require a visa to visit the Czech Republic.

**NOTE**: The Czech Republic is part of the EU, and part of the Schengen Area. So if you already have a valid Schengen visa, you may **NOT** need to apply for an Czech visa. Please check the website above and consult your local consular office or embassy, if you are uncertain.

If you do need a visa to attend EuroPython 2023, you can lodge a visa application issued for **[Short Stay (C), up to 90 days,  for the purpose of â€œBusiness /Conference"](https://www.mzv.cz/jnp/en/information_for_aliens/short_stay_visa/conference.html)**

Please make sure to read the visa pages and carefully and prepare all the required documents, before making your application. the EuroPython organisers are not equipped to give any visa advice.

If you do require a visa to travel to the Czech Republic, it is advisable to submit your visa application **as soon as possible, but at least 15 days** before your planned travel date.

## Visa Support Letter
Every registered attendee is welcome to request a visa support letter issued by the EuroPython Society, should you need one for your visa application. Once ticket sales open, we will open a form for you to request the support letter. Stay tuned!

<!-- Simply fill in the form **1 week before your planned visa application.**:

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>

</div>

We will send you the completed letter via email. -->

Please note that we only issue visa support letters to confirmed attendees. We kindly ask you to purchase your ticket before filling in the request form. If your company purchased the ticket on your behalf, please ask them to put you as an attendee, so you have the order code ready for the form.

If you find your visa application unsuccessful post the deadline for a refund (17th June), you can submit a special refund request by writing to [refunds@europython.eu](mailto:refunds@europython.eu).
