# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Gradio Hackathon ðŸ¤—
Come Join us at EuroPython from July 13th to 17th for Gradioâ€™s first ever in person & online hackathon! Build and host machine learning demos using [Gradio](http://gradio.app) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) to participate.

# Build cool demos!
 Are you interested in machine learning or already have a cool machine learning model you want to create a demo for? Join our [Gradio hackathon](https://huggingface.co/EuroPython2022) and submit and host your demo. For context, Gradio is a Python library that allows developers to demo machine learning models with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it ([learn more](http://gradio.app)). Browse through some existing demos on [Hugging Face spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). Join the Hugging Face organization [here](https://huggingface.co/organizations/EuroPython2022/share/JsnIYMRMwWreVmnLQLpPJfqZBhtKKZnMGV) to attend the hackathon.
