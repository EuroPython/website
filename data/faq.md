# FAQ

## **Q. When and where is EuroPython 2022 taking place?**

A. After 2 years of being fully remote, EuroPython 2022 will be held on
**11th-17th July** and it will be both in person and virtual.

The in-person conference will be held at
**[The Convention Centre Dublin (The CCD)](https://www.theccd.ie/) in Dublin,
Ireland**.

For the virtual conference, detailed instructions will be announced at a later
time.

## **Q. What will the schedule look like?**

A. The conference will be organised in three phases:

1. Monday & Tuesday (11.07 & 12.07): workshops and tutorials
2. Wednesday - Friday (13.07 - 15.07): main conference days
3. Saturday & Sunday (16.07 & 17.07): sprints (hackathon)

## **Q. What will the programme look like?**

A. To get an idea of what to expect, please have a look at the
[EP2021 programme](https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/sessions/) and the
[EP2019 programme](https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/sessions/).

To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated based
on the input from the community voting and expert panel reviews. Make sure to subscribe to our
[EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) for updates.

We aim to have a very diverse set of talks, tutorials, workshops, posters and
keynotes, covering many different angles of where and how Python can be used to
solve problems or do interesting things.

## **Q. When do you accept talk proposals?**

A. The [Call for Proposals](https://program.europython.eu/europython-2022/cfp) (CFP) opened on 8 March.

It has been extended for another week. New deadline: **3 April AoE**.

We are thrilled
to receive proposals on any topic that could be of interest to our community.

Especially if you are considering becoming a speaker for the first time, or if
you are from an underrepresented group, we strongly encourage you to send in
your proposals. We ran a
[Speaker Mentorship Programme](https://ep2022.europython.eu/mentorship) and matched 15 mentees and mentors. Check out the [AMA session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18donGcl0Jg) as part of the Mentorship Programme. Email us at ([program@europython.eu](mailto:program@europython.eu)) to tell us what other broader support you might need!

If you have something in mind, there is no better time to start preparing your
proposal! For more insights, please have a look at the
[EP2019 CFP page](https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/call-for-proposals/),
which was our last in-person conference. The overall structure for EP2022 remains the same.

## **Q. When will ticket sales start?**

A. Early Bird ticket sales started on 17 March! Regular tickets are also available alongside early birds tickets.

As usual, there are several ticket options, so you can choose the one most
suitable for you.

We offer flexibility for the tickets, depending on what you would like to attend. For the in-person conference, there will be:

## **Q. What are the ticket prices like?**

A. We have put a lot of work in keeping the ticket prices at a similar level to the last in-person conference in 2019, despite cost increases and the consequences of the pandemic.

Please check out our [Tickets page](https://ep2022.europython.eu/tickets) for more details.

We encourage and trust you to pick a fair ticket tier that fits your personal circumstance. The money you spend will be put straight back to the community to support our diversity initiatives, Financial Aid Programme and other grants offered to the European Python community. If you need help to attend the conference, you are most welcome to apply for [Financial Aid](https://ep2022.europython.eu/finaid)!

## **Q. How soon should I book accommodation and flights?**

A. The time and location of the conference have been set, so you can book at any time. We would recommend you consider flexible bookings in case of any changes of plans in the future as well as appropriate insurance cover.
