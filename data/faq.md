## **Q. What will the program look like?**

A. To get an idea of what to expect, please have a look at the [EP2021 program](https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/sessions/) and the [EP2019 program](https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/sessions/).

To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated based on the input from the community voting. Make sure to subscribe to our [EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) for updates.

We aim to have a very diverse set of talks, tutorials, workshops, posters and keynotes, covering many different angles of where and how Python can be used to solve problems or do interesting things.


## **Q. When will you start accepting talk proposals?**

A. The Call for Proposals (CFP) will be launched on **8 March**. We are thrilled to receive proposals on any topic that could be of interest to our community.

Especially if you are considering becoming a speaker for the first time, or if you are from an underrepresented group, we strongly encourage you to send in your proposals. There is a [Speaker Mentorship Programme](https://ep2022.europython.eu/mentorship) as well as broader support options.

If you have something in mind, there is no better time to start preparing your proposal! For more insights, please have a look at the [EP2019 CFP page](https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/call-for-proposals/), which was our last in-person conference. Some details may change for EP2022, but overall, the structure is going to be similar.
