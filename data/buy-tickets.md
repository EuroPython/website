## Which ticket type do I need to buy?

We would like to encourage and trust you, to pick a ticket type that reasonably fits your personal situation.

If a company is paying for your ticket and you need a proper VAT receipt (the personal tickets do not include a company name), please buy a business ticket.

If you are using Python as a hobby or as freelancer and don't need a VAT receipt, the personal ticket is for you.

Finally, if you are a student/postdoc researcher working in academia, we have the highly subsidized student ticket for you.

Please note that we will list the ticket type on the badge to make things easier for the registration desk personnel.

If you would like to support EuroPython, please consider getting a higher priced ticket. We assure you that your contribution will be put to good use. Thank you!

We would like to encourage you to buy your ticket as early as possible. This makes it easier for us to plan for the event and arrange e.g. the catering, print badges, etc.

If you have questions about our ticket prices, the process, etc. please check our FAQ document for answers. If you still have questions, please consult our EuroPython Helpdesk.
