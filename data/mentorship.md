Speaker Mentorship Program

As a diverse and inclusive community EuroPython offers support for potential
speakers who want help preparing for their contribution. To achieve this end
we have set up the speaker mentorship programme.

We are looking for both mentors and mentees to be a part of the programme.

_Applications will remain open until Sunday 20th March, 2022._

The mentorship program can be summarized into two types of activities:

## 1. The One-to-One Mentorship Programme

A mentee needing help will be matched with an experienced mentor. The mentor's
job will be to facilitate and support the mentee so they are able to contribute
to EuroPython with confidence. It is **not** the job of the mentor to tell the
mentee what their contribution should be (that's for the mentee to decide).
Rather, the mentor is a guide, supporter and source of help.

## 2. Webinar Workshops

### Ask Me Anything about CFP workshop - 23 March 2022 (Wednesday):

We encourage anyone who has no or little experience submitting to EuroPython's
CFP to join and ask questions. Questions can range from talk ideas, what makes
a good proposal to what is the selection process of the talk.

A recording of the session will be made available after the event.

### First Time Speaker Workshop - TBA:

EuroPython will provide a speaker training session for all selected speakers
explaining how to set up the technology required to present at EuroPython.
However, we would like to emphasize support for first-time speakers as they 
prepare their talk and learn what to expect when contributing to EuroPython.

## Mentors

To become a Mentor you need to fill in the application form
[here](https://forms.gle/QLfWU9bj1y5GRm219):

We expect mentors to have past speaking experience at conferences similar to
EuroPython.

For mentors who take on a mentee, we expect you to provide 4 one-hour
sessions with your mentee to:

- Prepare their CFP submission.
- Review their CFP before submission.
- If your mentee is selected, help them prepare the talk. Otherwise, help them
  submit their talk to another meetup/conference should they wish to.
- Help your mentee rehearse for their talk.

You will also be invited to join the panel of the Webinar Workshops.

## Mentee

If you require help when contributing to EuroPython, especially
if you are from an underrepresented or a marginalized group in the tech
industry, please fill in the form [here](https://forms.gle/QLfWU9bj1y5GRm219).
