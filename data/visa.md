# Visa Information

## Requirements
If you want to attend EuroPython 2022 in Dublin, Ireland, you should first verify whether you need a visa to enter Ireland, and apply for one if you do.

[This list of countries](https://irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Immigration-Service-Delivery-Visa-and-Non-Visa-Required-Countries.pdf) defines if you require a visa to visit Ireland.

Note: Ireland is part of the EU, but it is NOT part of the Schengen area. So if you are from outside the EU and have a Schengen visa, you may still need to apply for an Irish visa. Please check the website above if you are uncertain.

If you do need a visa to attend EuroPython 2022, you can apply for the Irish [Short Stay (C) - Conference/Event Visa](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-less-than-90-days/conference-event-visa/) (Answer *reason for travel: ‘Conference/Event’*).

Please make sure to read the visa pages (linked above) carefully before making your application; the EuroPython organisers are not equipped to give any visa advice. If you do require a visa to travel to Ireland, it is advisable to submit your visa application at least **8 weeks** before your planned travel date.

## Visa Support Letters
If you have a ticket to attend EuroPython 2022 and require a visa, you are welcome to apply for a support letter from the EuroPython Society. Simply fill in the form:

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<ButtonLink href="https://forms.gle/WE5Uv2KxoEyzrmEE6">Visa Support Letter Request Form</ButtonLink>
</div>

We will send you the completed letter via email.

Please note that we only issue visa support letters to confirmed attendees. We kindly ask you to purchase your ticket before filling in the request form. If your company purchased the ticket on your behalf, please ask them to put you as an attendee, so you have the order code ready for the form.

If you find your visa application unsuccessful post the deadline for a refund (11th June), you can submit a special refund request by writing to [refunds@europython.eu](mailto:refunds@europython.eu).

## Other questions
If you have any questions, please send an email to: [board@europython.eu](mailto:board@europython.eu).
