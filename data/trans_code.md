## What Is Trans\*Code? ##

After nearly 3 years of hiatus, [Trans\*Code](https://www.trans.tech/) will be returning! We are delighted that EuroPython will be hosting a Trans*Code event in Dublin in July!

Trans\*Code is an international hack event series focused solely on drawing attention to transgender issues and opportunities. Trans*Code events aim to help draw attention to transgender issues through informal, topic-focused hackdays. Coders, designers, activists, and community members not currently working in technology are also encouraged to participate.

## Trans*Code @ EuroPython ##

The Trans\*Code event at EuroPython will take place on **Tuesday 12 July, 2022**.

It is a free full day workshop & hackday open to trans and non-binary folk, allies, coders, designers and visionaries of all sorts.
