But he also understands that it is a gradual process and thus it is important to always look back every few months and refractor the code whenever possible so that it's easier to debug in case of any issues. \r\nHe has taken multiple workshops in the past to promote the same and encouraged many engineers to not neglect the power of well refactored code. \r\nHe has taught more than 15000 budding engineers and wants to create a community of people with impactful skills. He runs a YouTube channel with a 25k+ subscriber base where he shares unpopular opinions and his tech journey experiences. \r\nIn his free time, he likes to play chess and mentor budding engineers in the industry.",

The main focus of my research at third level (including my PhD) was the early identification of students who were at risk of failing or dropping out of Computer Science (using machine learning techniques), as well as interventions to try and reduce attrition rates. My research also focuses on gender and inclusion, with an aim to reduce stereotypes and promote the Computer Science discipline across all levels of education. I am the co-chair of the ACM ITiCSE conference for 2022. My primary area of teaching is in Software Development, (CS1 and CS2: C#, Java and Python) and Applied Machine Learning with Artificial Intelligence. To complement my Computer Science Education research at third level, I have also been significantly involved at primary and second level Computer Science Education, from Governmental level with commissioned research, to co-authoring the leaving certificate book, to formal and informal teacher professional development, to leading a large scale national, primary and second level Computer Science outreach and research programme (http://CSinc.ie). I am also a member of the EU Commission expert group on AI and data in education and training.",
