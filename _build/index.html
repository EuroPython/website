    <h1 style="text-align: center">FAQ</h1>

    <h2>When and where is EuroPython 2022 taking place?</h2>

    <p>
      After 2 years of being fully remote, EuroPython 2022 will be held on
      11th-17th July and it will be both in person and virtual.
    </p>

    <p>
      The in-person conference will be held at The Convention Centre Dublin (The
      CCD) in Dublin, Ireland.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the virtual conference, detailed instructions will be announced at a
      later time.
    </p>

    <h2>What will the schedule look like?</h2>

    <p>The conference will be organised in three phases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Monday &amp; Tuesday (11.07 &amp; 12.07): workshops and tutorials</li>
      <li>Wednesday - Friday (13.07 - 15.07): main conference days</li>
      <li>Saturday &amp; Sunday (16.07 &amp; 17.07): sprints (hackathon)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As usual, there will be several ticket options, so you can choose the one
      most suitable for you. Details will be announced at the end of February.
    </p>

    <h2>What will the program look like?</h2>

    <p>
      To get an idea of what to expect, please have a look at the
      <a href="https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/sessions/">EP2021 program</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/sessions/">EP2019 program</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated
      based on the input from the community voting. Make sure to subscribe to
      our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
      for updates.
    </p>

    <h2>When will you start accepting talk proposals?</h2>

    <p>
      The Call for Proposals (CFP) will be launched in early March. We are
      thrilled to receive proposals on any topic that could be of interest to
      our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially if you are considering becoming a speaker for the first time,
      or if you are from an underrepresented group, we strongly encourage you to
      send in your proposals. There is a speaker mentorship program as well as
      broader support options. Make sure to subscribe to our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
      for updates.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have something in mind, there is no better time to start preparing
      your proposal! For more insights, please have a look at the EP2019 CFP
      page, which was our last in-person conference. Some details may change for
      EP2022, but overall, the structure is going to be similar.
    </p>

    <h2>When will ticket sales start?</h2>

    <p>
      Ticket sales will start in March. Make sure to subscribe to our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
      where the opening dates will be announced on 28 February.
    </p>

    <h2>What will the ticket prices be like?</h2>

    <p>
      We are aiming to keep the ticket prices similar to the last in-person
      conference in 2019, though an increase could be necessary due to cost
      increases and the consequences of the pandemic.
    </p>

    <p>
      As always, we will announce these on our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Will there be a Financial Aid program for EP2022?</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, we will have a Financial Aid program this year similar to the one we
      had in 2019. Please watch out for announcements on the
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
    </p>

    <h2>How soon should I book accommodation and flights?</h2>

    <p>
      The time and location of the conference have been set, so you can book at

    <h2>
      Will I get a ticket refund or exchange if I cannot travel due to COVID
      restrictions?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Travelling can be expected to be complicated during a pandemic. We will
      aim to offer a full refund of the conference ticket if your circumstances
      change.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a refund after this date, please contact us at
      board@europython.eu

      and there will be appropriate safety precautions at the venue. As of 21

    <h2>Do I need to wear a mask during the conference?</h2>

    <p>
      You are not required to wear a mask but please be mindful of people who
      want to do so. Risk is perceived differently by people and you should
      respect their choice.

    <p>
      No, as of 21 January 2022 social distancing is not required. Please
      respect the choices of your fellow attendees if they ask you to keep your
      distance from them.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I need to be vaccinated to attend the conference in person?</h2>

    <p>
